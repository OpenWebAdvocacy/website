The Open Web Advocacy is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities.
We are applying the relevant accessibility standards, and we will do our best to continually improve the user experience
for everyone.

## Measures to support accessibility

As a team of enthusiastic volunteers, we are focusing our efforts on web standards and semantic HTML.

The tests done during development are:

- checking for general accessibility problems with WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool);
- navigating the site using the keyboard;
- using NVDA screen reader.

## Feedback

We welcome your feedback on the accessibility of our pages.
If you encounter any accessibility barriers accessing our content, please let us know by email:
