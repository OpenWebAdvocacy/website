  2. Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  The Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to restore contestability, interoperability,
  choice and fairness back to digital markets in the EU. These fundamental
  properties of an effectively functioning digital market have been eroded by the
  extreme power gatekeepers wield via their control of “core platform services”.
</p>
<p>
  The lack of competition on mobile ecosystems is, at its heart, a structural one.
  Gatekeepers wield vast power due to the security model that these devices are
  built on. Traditionally, on operating systems such as Windows, macOS and Linux,
  users can install any application they want, with no interaction from the
  operating system gatekeeper, either by the business or the end user. Users can
  then grant these programs the ability to do anything they desire.
</p>
<p>
  Locking down what applications can do, such as restricting which APIs they can
  access behind user permissions, is not by itself anti-competitive and can bring
  legitimate security advantages. However, the manner in which it has been
  implemented on mobile devices is both self-serving and in its current form,
  significantly damages competition.
</p>
<p>
  This damage surfaces in several forms:
</p>
<p>
  First, the gatekeeper can control what is allowed to be installed on devices
  they have already sold to consumers, often for a significant profit. They
  utilize this device-level control to demand a 30% cut of all third-party
  software that the consumer installs, not on merit, but simply because they
  control the only mechanisms available to businesses to release that software,
  and can further block or hinder the consumer from using or acquiring services
  outside of their app store.
</p>
<p>
  The second is more subtle. In order to deliver their “native” apps to consumers
  on Android or iOS, developers must create custom applications in specific
  programming languages for each individual platform. Typically, companies will
  require separate development teams for each OS. This not only multiplies
  development and maintenance cost, but puts in place an invisible barrier to
  interoperability. Even the built up expertise for creating software for a
  specific platform provides significant lock-in advantages to the platform’s
  gatekeeper.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, even if a developer has no desire to interact with the gatekeeper, they
  are forced into a commercial and legally binding relationship with them. This is
  due to the fact that the gatekeeper inserts itself between the customer and
  these third party developers. With smartphones now 15 years old, this may seem
  normal to us now, but imagine if Microsoft demanded that every software provider
  signed an onerous contract with them or be barred from releasing a product on
  Windows. What would have been unacceptable, anti-competitive behavior to both
  consumers, businesses and regulators on desktop, has been tolerated on mobile
  simply because these computers were considered a “new” category.
</p>
<p>
  Mobile devices are just small computers whose primary input is touch, there is
  no sacred or magical property that means they have to run on a proprietary app
  store model. Nothing is stopping mobile computers running on the open model that
  desktop computers run on, just as there is nothing stopping a desktop computer
  running the app store model. Inertia and great profits are however powerful
  forces. Between them, Apple and Google have created a powerful and entrenched
  duopoly.
</p>
<p>
  Even with the DMA forcing Apple to open up the ecosystem to competition, Apple
  is still inserting themselves front and center between consumers and app
  developers. They insist all developers for iOS/iPadOS (including developers who
  have no intention of using their app store) pay them $100 per year, that they
  sign the full Apple developer program contract and submit themselves to what is
  effectively app store review (although nominally locked to security). Worse,
  they are attaching significant recurring penalty fees to developers who dare to
  make their software available outside of Apple’s app store. Apple is using every
  tool at their disposal to dissuade developers from leaving their app store and
  to undermine the goals of the DMA.
</p>
<p>
  Apple's key excuse to impose this control is security. Apple's argument is, in
  essence, that only they can be trusted to vet what consumers are allowed to
  install on their devices. All third parties must submit to their review.
</p>
<p>
  What is needed is a way to securely run interoperable and capable software
  across all operating systems. Luckily, such a solution already exists and is not
  only thriving on open desktop platforms but is dominating, and that
  dominance is growing every year. The solution is of course, the Web and more
  specifically Web Apps. Today, more than 60% of users' time on desktop is done
  using web technologies, and that looks set to only grow.
</p>
<p>
  Web Apps have a number of properties that allow them to solve this critical
  problem. They are run in the security of the browser's sandbox, which <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62277271d3bf7f158779fe39/Apple_11.3.22.pdf">even
    Apple admits is “orders of magnitude more stringent than the sandbox for native
    iOS apps.”</a>. They are truly interoperable between operating systems. They
  don't require developers to sign contracts with any of the OS gatekeepers. They
  are capable of incredible things and 90% of the apps on your phone could be
  written as one today.
</p>
<p>
  So why aren't they thriving on mobile? The simple answer to this question is
  lack of browser competition on iOS and active hostility by Apple towards
  effective Web App support, both by their own browser and by their OS. Apple's
  own browser faces no competition on iOS, as they have effectively barred the
  other browsers from competing by prohibiting them from using or modifying their
  engines, the core part of what allows browser vendors to differentiate in
  stability, features, security and privacy.
</p>
<p>
  The DMA explicitly sets out to right this wrong by mandating that gatekeepers
  can no longer enact such a ban:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In particular, each browser is built on a web
    browser engine,
    which is responsible for key browser functionality such as
    speed, reliability and web compatibility. When gatekeepers
    operate and impose web browser engines, they are in a position
    to determine the functionality and standards that will apply
    not only to their own web browsers, but also to competing web
    browsers and, in turn, to &gt;web software applications.
    Gatekeepers
    should therefore not use their position to require their
    dependent business users to use any of the services provided
    together with, or in support of, core platform services by the
    gatekeeper itself as part of the provision of services or
    products by those business users.

        Markets Act - Recital 43</a>
    </cite>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The intent stated for this in the DMA is to prevent gatekeepers from dictating
  the speed, stability, compatibility and feature set of “web software
  applications”.
</p>
<p>
  Apple has announced new rules that would, at first glance, allow browser vendors
  to port their real browsers to iOS. However, on closer inspection, this is a
  mirage. Instead Apple appears intent on making it <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052067/mozilla-apple-ios-browser-rules-firefox">“as
    painful as possible” for browser vendors</a> to port their engines to
  iOS/iPadOS. As we will outline in our paper, Apple's current proposal falls far
  short of compliance. Apple is not only undermining browser competition on iOS,
  but appears to be actively attempting to prevent the growth of an entire open
  and interoperable ecosystem that could feasibly supplant and replace their app
  store model.
</p>
<p>
  Apple have seen the Web as a threat to their app store as far back as 2011, when
  Philip Schiller internally sent an email to Eddie Cue titled “HTML5 poses a
  threat to both Flash and the App Store”.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Food for thought: Do we think our 30/70% split will last forever? While I am a
    staunch supporter of the 30/70% split and keeping it simple and consistent across
    our stores, I don’t think 30/70 will last unchanged forever. I think someday we will
    see a challenge from another platform or a web based solution to want to adjust our
    model.

      </a>
    </cite>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  This attitude appears not to have changed. Faced with the genuine possibility of third-
  party browsers effectively powering Web Apps, Apple's first instinct appears to have
  been to <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/its-official-apple-kills-web-apps-in-the-eu/">
    remove Web Apps support entirely with no notice to either businesses or
    consumers</a>. Luckily, <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/apple-backs-off-killing-web-apps/">
    under significant pressure, Apple backed down</a> from this particular
  stunt at the last moment.
</p>

<p>
  Apple is very explicit in its public statement that they initially planned to remove the
  functionality as the DMA would force them to share it with third-party browsers. Even in
  their statement backing down, they make it clear they do not intend to allow third-party
  browsers that use their own engine to be able to install and manage Web Apps. In both
  statements, Apple cites "security" as the reason for their decisions.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately for Apple, it has been unable to prove that Safari or WebKit are actually
  more secure than its competitors. When obligated by the UK’s Competition and Markets
  Authority to provide evidence to back up its assertion that WebKit was more secure than
  Blink or Gecko, Apple failed to do so.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... the evidence that we have seen to date does not suggest that there are material
    differences in the security performance of WebKit and alternative browser engines.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Overall, the evidence we have received to date does not suggest that Apple's
    WebKit restriction allows for quicker and more effective response to security threats
    for dedicated browser apps on iOS.

  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Apple's actions not only hurt the Web ecosystem, third-party businesses (be they
  browser vendors or software developers), but also make their devices worse for their own
  consumers. By depriving their consumers of the choice and competition that fair and
  effective browser and Web App competition would bring, they are worsening the
  functionality, interoperability, stability, security, privacy, and price of services on their
  devices.
</p>
<p>
  A reasonable person might argue
  <em>Why would Apple make their own devices worse, surely
    better devices means more hardware sales?</em> This behavior comes, however, with key
  advantages for Apple, even if they harm Apple's own consumers.
</p>

<p>
  Critically, service revenue is of growing importance for Apple as
  <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99zxzjqw2ko">their hardware sales have
    peaked and are declining</a>. Apple has not had a “hit” new product for 14 years, namely the
  iPad, and, if you are being generous, 9 years for the Apple Watch. It does not currently
  seem likely that Apple’s VR/AR headset
  <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-vision-pro-sales-drop">will
    have any significant impact on Apple’s overall
    hardware sales</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The UK regulator cites two incentives: protecting their app store revenue from
  competition from Web Apps, and protecting their Google search deal from competition
  from third-party browsers.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong class="stressed">Apple receives significant revenue from Google
      by setting Google Search as the
      default search engine on Safari</strong>, and therefore benefits financially
    from high usage
    of Safari. [...] <strong class="stressed">The WebKit restriction may help to
      entrench this position</strong> by limiting
    the scope for other browsers on iOS to differentiate themselves from Safari [...] As
    a result, it is less likely that users will choose other browsers over Safari, which in
    turn <strong class="stressed">secures Apple’s revenues from Google</strong>.
    [...]
    Apple generates revenue through its App Store, both by charging developers for
    access to the App Store and by taking a commission for payments made via Apple
    IAP. Apple therefore benefits from higher usage of native apps on iOS. By requiring
    all browsers on iOS to use the WebKit browser engine,
    <strong class="stressed">Apple is able to exert control
      over the maximum functionality of all browsers on iOS</strong> and, as a consequence,
    hold up the development and use of web apps. This limits the <strong class="stressed">competitive
      constraint that web apps pose on native apps</strong>, which in turn protects and benefits
    Apple’s App Store revenues.

      <br>(emphasis added)
    </cite>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  These two revenue streams are vast, even for a company of Apple’s size. Apple collected
  <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/apple-app-store-revenue-update-shows-slowing-growth-.html#:~:text=If%20all%20developers%20paid%20a%2030%25%20cut%20to,billion%20in%202022%2C%20based%20on%20a%20CNBC%20analysis.">
    $85 billion USD in App Store fees in 2022</a>,
  of which it keeps approximately 30%. Apple
  reportedly receives
  <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/10/google_pays_apple_18_20_claims_bernstein/#:~:text=%22We%20estimate%20that%20the%20ISA,of%20Apple's%20annual%20operating%20profits.%22">
    $18-20 billion USD</a> a year from their Google Search engine deal,
  accounting for 14-16 percent of Apple's annual operating profits.
</p>
<p>
  A third and interesting incentive the CMA does not cite, but which the US's Department of
  Justice does, is that this behavior greatly weakens the interoperability of Apple's devices,
  making it harder for consumers to switch or multi-home. It also greatly raises the barriers
  of entry for new mobile operating system entrants by depriving them of a library of
  interoperable apps.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong class="stressed">Apple has long understood how middleware can help promote
      competition</strong> and
    its myriad benefits, including increased innovation and output,
    <strong class="stressed">by increasing scale and interoperability</strong>.
    [...]
    In the context of smartphones, examples of
    <strong class="stressed">middleware include internet browsers</strong>,
    internet or cloud-based apps, super apps, and smartwatches, among other products
    and services.
    [...]
    <strong class="stressed">
      Apple has limited the capabilities of third-party iOS web browsers, including by
      requiring that they use Apple’s browser engine, WebKit</strong>.
    [...]
    Apple has sole discretion to review and approve all apps and app updates.
    <strong class="stressed">Apple
      selectively exercises that discretion to its own benefit</strong>, deviating from or changing
    its guidelines when it suits Apple’s interests and allowing Apple executives to control
    app reviews and decide whether to approve individual apps or updates. Apple often
    enforces its App Store rules arbitrarily.
    <strong class="stressed">And it frequently uses App Store rules and
      restrictions to penalize and restrict developers that take advantage of
      technologies that threaten to disrupt, disintermediate, compete with, or erode
      Apple’s monopoly power</strong>.

<p>
  Interoperability via middleware would reduce lock-in for Apple’s devices. Lock-in is a clear
  reason for Apple to block interoperability, as can be seen in this email exchange where
  Apple executives dismiss the idea of bringing iMessage to Android.
</p>

<p>The DMA has the power to fix all of these underlying issues and unleash a powerful,
  open, interoperable and secure competitor to not only Apple's
  app store but also Google's. Lack of
  contestability for mobile app stores and mobile operating systems is
  a key concern for the DMA that viable Web
  Apps solve.
</p>

<p>This will also remove a heavy burden from new entrants into the operating system
  market; lack of apps. No longer will developers need to develop custom apps
  for each operating system, any
  operating system with good web app support and browser competition will support
  all web apps automatically. Web
  Apps support operating systems that developers have not even heard of.
  The impact of allowing them to compete
  fairly on mobile will be profound.
</p>

<p>
  We request the Commission open a proceeding into Apple and investigate what we allege
  is severe and deliberate non-compliance. The number of ways that Apple is not complying is so myriad that we,
  recognising that the commision does not have infinite resources to pursue all of them simultaneously, have split
  them into three tranches of remedies.
</p>
<p>Some remedies require time and/or pre-requisite remedies in order to be effective.
  Remedies in this document are ordered to ensure that either competitive benefits are delivered earlier or to
  unlock future remedies. In this way, we propose a program of continual improvement in the competitive landscape,
  delivering wins at every step along the path.
</p>

<p>While we have attempted to be comprehensive, it is possible, and perhaps even likely,
  that there will be infringements that we have not included or are not yet aware of.
</p>

<p>Our proposed remedies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Restricting Apple's API contract for browsers down to strictly necessary,
    proportionate and justified security measures.</li>
  <li>Make clear what the security measures are for third party browsers using
    their own engine by publishing them in a single up-to-date document.</li>
  <li>Removing any App Store rule that would prevent third party browsers from
    competing fairly.</li>
  <li>Allow browser vendors to keep their existing EU consumers when switching
    to use their own engine.</li>
  <li>Removing the special placement of Safari.</li>
  <li>Making Safari uninstallable.</li>
  <li>Implementing Install Prompts in iOS Safari for Web Apps.</li>
  <li>Allowing Browser Vendors and Developers to be able to test their browsers
    and web software outside the EU.</li>
  <li>Allowing Browsers using their own engine to install and manage Web Apps.</li>
  <li>Make notarization a fast and automatic process, as on macOS.</li>
  <li>Allow direct browser installation independently from Apple’s app store.</li>
  <li>Allow users to switch to different distribution methods of a native
    app and allow developers to promote that option to the user.</li>
  <li>Don't break third party browsers for EU residents who are traveling.</li>
  <li>Opt-Into Rights contract should be removed.</li>
  <li>Core Technology Fee should be removed.</li>
  <li>Apple should publish a new more detailed compliance plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apple is obligated under Articles 5(7), 6(3), 6(4) and 6(7) to fix each
  of the above issues. Apple has failed to achieve effective compliance
  with these obligations contrary to Article 13(3). Further Apple has
  taken numerous and significant steps that obstruct and undermine it in
  contravention of Article 13(4). Apple has introduced conditions and
  restrictions on DMA-conferred rights that have no legal basis in the
  DMA and gone far beyond the restrictions that the DMA does allow by
  introducing rules that have no basis in security or that are not justified,
  strictly necessary or proportionate.
</p>

<p>Any intervention that the Commission makes will have global ramifications. Regulators around the world are carefully watching the implementation of the DMA as they plan their own regulatory regimes. Already <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/japan-ends-the-apple-browser-ban/">Japan has become the second jurisdiction in the world to explicitly prohibit banning browser engines</a>. <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/new-digital-competition-laws-for-australia/">Australia</a>, <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/owa-2023-review/#korea%2C-brazil%2C-india">India, Korea and Brazil</a> are all planning on implementing their own versions of the DMA. The UK has just <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/uk-passes-dmcc/">passed the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill</a> that grants their regulator great power to enforce codes of conduct against tech giants.
</p>

<p>Successful resolution of these issues have an exceptional chance of becoming de facto global, as no jurisdiction will want to miss out on clear benefits being enjoyed by EU consumers. However, if Apple manages to successfully avoid complying with the DMA, these problems could persist indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
  We urge the Commission to enforce the DMA and obligate Apple to allow
  browsers and Web Apps to compete fairly and effectively on their mobile ecosystem.
  This will unlock contestability, fairness and interoperability. Companies will then
  have to compete for users on merit, not via lock-in or control over operating
  systems. Consumers will benefit from choice, better quality and cheaper software,
  interoperability, and the genuine ability to multihome across devices and operating
  systems offered by different companies.
</p>

<p>
  These changes can finally fix a mobile ecosystem that has been
  structurally broken, and artificially hindered, for more than a decade.

  3.1.1. API Contract not Restricted to Only Security
</h4>

<p>
  As part of Apple’s compliance proposal, Apple published a new contract,
  namely the “Web Browser Engine Entitlement Addendum for Apps in the EU”.
</p>

<p>
  This is a contract to be allowed to have the “Alternative Web Browser
  Engine App (EU)” entitlement profile. To understand what an entitlement is,
  we can look to Apple’s documentation:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong class="stressed">An entitlement is a right or privilege that grants
      an executable particular
      capabilities</strong>. For example, an app needs the HomeKit Entitlement — along with
    explicit user consent — to access a user’s home automation network. An app
    stores its entitlements as key-value pairs embedded in the code signature of
    its binary executable.
    <cite>
      <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements">
        Apple Developer Documentation</a>
      <br>(emphasis added)
    </cite>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  An entitlement is a permission which grants applications the ability
  to access some specific hardware or software features of the operating
  system. For example Apple grants the Safari app the ability to access
  bluetooth via the “com.apple.bluetooth.internal” entitlement.
</p>

<p>
  The contract further specifies:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    &lsquo;Alternative Web Browser Engine APIs&rsquo; means the restricted Application
    Programming Interfaces (&lsquo;APIs&rsquo;) contained in the Apple Software, which
    are provided to You under this Addendum for using an Alternative Web Browser Engine.
    <cite>
      <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/web_browser_engine.pdf">
        Web Browser Engine Entitlement Addendum for Apps in the EU</a>
    </cite>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  This therefore means that this contract is Apple’s terms and conditions
  for access to these APIs. This applies not only to browsers installed
  from Apple’s app store but also <strong>applies to browsers that are either
    installed from a different app store or directly from a website</strong>.
</p>

<p>The DMA states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Article 6(7) <strong class="stressed">
      The gatekeeper shall allow providers of services and
      providers of hardware, free of charge, effective interoperability with,
      and access for the purposes of interoperability to, the same hardware
      and software features accessed or controlled via the operating system
      or virtual assistant listed in the designation decision pursuant to
      Article 3(9) as are available to services or hardware provided by the
      gatekeeper</strong>. Furthermore, the gatekeeper shall allow business users
    and alternative providers of services provided together with, or in
    support of, core platform services, free of charge, effective
    interoperability with, and access for the purposes of interoperability
    to, the same operating system, hardware or software features,
    regardless of whether those features are part of the operating system,
    as are available to, or used by, that gatekeeper when providing such
    services.
    <strong class="stressed">The gatekeeper shall not be prevented from taking strictly necessary
      and proportionate measures to ensure that interoperability does not
      compromise the integrity of the operating system, virtual assistant,
      hardware or software features provided by the gatekeeper, provided
      that such measures are duly justified by the gatekeeper.</strong>

<p>
  This is clearly a strong restriction on which conditions Apple can place
  on general API access. That is, while 6(7) allows Apple to have a
  number of strictly necessary, proportionate and justified security
  conditions to protect the integrity of the operating system, it is
  not allowed to then add any other conditions it may want.
</p>

<p>
  Apple’s contract helpfully separates out which conditions Apple
  considers to be security requirements in two sections: “You must
  meet the following security requirements” and “3.1 Security”.
</p>

<p>
  Apple should ensure that each and every condition in this contract is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>To protect the integrity of the operating system</li>
  <li>Strictly necessary</li>
  <li>Proportionate</li>
  <li>Duly justified by Apple</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>This immediately strikes out all conditions in the contract that
    are not security conditions - which make up the majority of the contract.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Apple must remove all non-security terms from its browser engine entitlement contract. The contract must only
  contain terms allowed by Article 6(7) of the DMA. OWA supports the contract spelling out the necessary,
  proportionate, and justified security rules to protect the integrity of the operating system.

  3.1.1.1. Article 5(7) - No Security Exceptions
</h4>

<p>
  Under Article 5(7), Apple is obligated to allow browser vendors to port their existing browser engines to iOS.
  Article 5(7) contains no security exceptions.
</p>
<p>
  This means Apple can not seek to prevent or hinder the features and functionality that browser engines can provide
  by claiming exemptions under security. Article 13(3) and 13(4) in conjunction with 5(7) means that Apple must enable
  browser vendors to port their browser engines in their entirety, and Apple must provide those engines the access and
  integration they require to operate.
</p>
<p>
  We would propose that the Commission therefore looks at security rules through this lens and ensure that any
  security rule that would significantly hinder browser vendors from porting their existing engines should be struck
  out. Major browser vendors take security extremely seriously and will likely voluntarily accept a number of rules
  related to patching and promptly fixing vulnerabilities as they already do this for every other operating system.
</p>
<p>
  Thus, any app store or API contract rule that would make it extremely difficult or impossible for a competent
  browser vendor to port their existing browser (with its engine) to iOS would be in violation of Article 5(7) and
  Article 13(4).
</p>
<p>
  If we look at the intent of Article 5(7) with respect to browser engines it goes further. The intent is spelt out in
  this segment of Recital 43:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    In particular, each browser is built on a web browser engine, which is responsible for key browser functionality
    such as speed, reliability and web compatibility. When gatekeepers operate and impose web browser engines, they
    are in a position to determine the functionality and standards that will apply not only to their own web browsers,
    but also to competing web browsers and, in turn, to web software applications.”
    <cite>
      <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ%3AL%3A2022%3A265%3ATOC&uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2022.265.01.0001.01.ENG">
        Digital Markets Act - Recital 43</a>
      <br>(emphasis added)
    </cite>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The intent is to allow third-party browser vendors to contest the functionality, speed and stability of the
  gatekeepers browser, including in the provision of the functionality of Web Apps.
</p>
<p>
  This means that any app store or API contract rule that would block functionality from a third-party browser would
  be in violation of Article 5(7) and 13(4). The most that Apple can insist upon is that browser vendors take
  reasonable steps to mitigate any security issues to at least the baseline level of security for that API (or
  equivalent APIs) on iOS.
</p>
<p>
  OWA expects that browser vendors should be subject to security requirements, but as previously stated, security
  should not be used to block the ability of browsers and Web Apps to compete with the gatekeepers native apps and
  services.
</p>
<p>
  In summary, <strong>security rules (and other app store rules) that violate
    Article 5(7) should be modified or struck out</strong>.

  3.1.2. Must not use the Browser Engine of the Operating System
</h3>

<p>
  Due to Apple’s 15 year ban of third-party browser engines, browser vendors will need to gradually phase in their own
  engines over time using phased roll-outs and multi-variant testing. Deploying an engine to a new operating system is
  a complex process and has to be done in a slow and methodical manner to identify bugs and performance issues.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, it is essential that all browser vendors be allowed to ship dual engine browsers. That is, browsers
  that can use both the system provided WKWebView and their own engine within a single binary. Technically the binary
  would only contain the code for a single engine, the one the browser vendor provides, since the WKWebView is an
  operating system provided component.
</p>
<p>
  However, Apple has added a rule in their contract to explicitly ban this:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Be a separate binary from any Application that uses the system-provided
    web browser engine
    <cite>
      <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/web_browser_engine.pdf">
        Web Browser Engine Entitlement Addendum for Apps in the EU</a>
    </cite>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To our knowledge there is no reasonable or rational reason to impose this
  restriction.</p>

<p>It is not entirely clear what this rule means, but the most obvious interpretation is
  that the browser is not allowed to make use of the WKWebView. Potentially it could mean that the browser is also
  not able to make use of or call SFSafariViewController (which may have some niche use cases even for browsers that
  ship their own engine).</p>

<p>The WKWebView is an operating system component, and thus a software feature of iOS
  covered under Article 6(7). Since Apple has not provided any security justification for this rule, nor do we
  believe one plausibly exists, this term is in clear contravention of 6(7).</p>

<p>Without explanation we can only guess Apple’s reasons for adding this rule. The
  most obvious guess is that Apple is simply being malicious by ensuring browser vendors can not update their
  existing browser app to use their own engine, which will then ensure that those browser vendors will lose all
  their existing EU customers if they attempt to port their engine over.</p>

<p>It is also possible that this is simply as childish and anticompetitive as “if
  you want to not be forced to use it, then you're not allowed to use it at all”. Apple has behaved in a
  similar manner in a number of other instances with their app store and their payment handler.</p>

<p>A significant consequence of this rule is that it makes phasing in the engine over time
  with A/B testing impossible. A/B testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) is a methodology for
  comparing two versions of an app in order to know which performs better. In the case of browsers, there are bugs
  which only occur rarely i.e for 1/10,000 or 1/100,000 users. In order to pick up these bugs before releasing them
  on millions of users, browser vendors turn on features for a percentage of users (i.e 1% or .1%) to catch issues.
  This is a critical part of browser development. </p>

<p>In this case, browser vendors will be toggling users between the WebKit version of
  their browser and their own engine version of their browser so as to collect sufficient bug data to make their own
  engine version stable. Such a rule would make this impossible.</p>

<p>This will make it significantly more difficult for browser vendors to port their
  engines, let alone have a successful product using their own engine which meets or exceeds the quality and
  adoption of their WebKit WebView-based browser. This is the only real plausible purpose of the rule. Coupled with
  the complete lack of security or any other justification, this rule would be in violation of Article 5(7), and
  Article 13(4).</p>

<p>Thus, under Article 5(7), Article 6(7), and Article 13(4) <strong>Apple must
    allow browser vendors to ship “dual engine” browsers by removing</strong>
  <q>Be a separate binary from any Application that uses the system-provided
    web browser engine</q> from their browser engine entitlement contract and not
  include an equivalent rule in their
  app store rules.

  3.1.3. Must be New and Separate App
</h3>

<p>Apple has a number of rules making it clear that the Web Browser Engine Entitlement
  will only be provided in the EU. Additionally, they will force browser vendors to submit a brand new
  application called an "Alternative Web Browser Engine App (EU)" in the contract.</p>

<blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>Be distributed solely on iOS in the European Union;</li>
    <li><strong class="stressed">Be a separate binary from any Application that uses the

        Apple’s Browser Engine Entitlement Contract
      </a>
    </cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple has chosen to restrict browser competition on iOS to the EU. This means under
  Apple's current proposal all browsers that intend to bring and modify their own engine will need to create a
  brand new application. Existing users will need to switch to this "new" app or remain siloed on the
  existing WKWebView version of their browser.</p>

<p>The rule to ship a separate app in the EU does not affect Safari, as the WKWebView is
  under Apple's sole control, contains Safari's engine and is updated in lockstep with Safari. That is to
  say: the system provided browser engine is Safari’s engine, hence they are automatically exempt from this
  rule.</p>

<p>For a third-party browser to make this transition, they would need to ship a new app,
  and then advertise to the existing users to switch to the new app. The ramifications of this is so severe
  it’s unlikely any browser vendor would be willing to take this step as it causes serious issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browser vendors would likely lose a significant percentage of
    their existing users in the transition.</li>
  <li>Their "real" browser (i.e. the one they ship on every
    other operating system) will start with zero installs. This means that, even after a period of time, it may
    still not be eligible for the choice screen as it only displays the top 12 browsers for the country of the user.
    It would be worth investigating whether imposing the “new and separate app rule” would therefore
    breach 13(4)’s effective compliance obligation in relation to Apple’s 6(3) choice screen
    obligations.</li>
  <li>This introduces considerable friction and complexity into porting
    users data, login cookies and settings to the new app. This is problematic as:
    <ul>
      <li>In some cases user’s data will be lost in the
        transfer.</li>
      <li> Significant development work will be required to sync it.</li>
      <li>It is unclear what to do for users that become and cease to be EU
        residents,an artificial problem caused by Apple's geolock.</li>
      <li>Users opting to keep both applications may find their information
        out of sync across the two.</li>
      <li>Browsers will likely want to avoid any high-friction method such as
        requiring the user to sign-in to use browser cloud syncing
        functionality, if available.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This is likely to lead to significant user confusion and frustration. Many
    users are completely unaware that they are not using the “real” versions of popular browsers. This
    is further complicated by Apple’s insistence (previously indefinitely, now for the next 6 months) that
    browser vendors would not be able to port their browsers to iPad in the EU. Most users are not concerned with
    what engine their browser uses, rather they are concerned with the features, stability, speed, security and
    privacy, etc. that different browsers offer relative to each other.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  It is unlikely that a browser vendor
  would do a major advertising campaign for the EU for their updated browser that would inadvertently highlight
  the shortcomings of their WkWebView based browser to other large markets. While there is a high probability that
  Apple will be forced to allow browser competition on iOS in most (if not all) jurisdictions in the future, it is
  equally likely that there will be a multi-year lag. Browser vendors will not wish to lose market share with
  their WkWebView based browsers in those jurisdictions while they wait for change.
</p>

<p>All of this is avoided if the browser vendor can simply update their existing
  application.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, if Apple were to update the technology powering the Apple TV app, they
  would not force all their users to download and sign into a new app. They would simply silently update the
  technology under the hood for all users, providing them a better product with no friction or user frustration. To
  force browser vendors to have to ship a new app simply to update the underlying technology is both unreasonable
  and anti-competitive. Particularly when allowing browser vendors to use their own engines for their browser is
  directly compelled via the DMA.</p>

  3.1.3.1. Potential Solutions

<p>There are a three potential solutions open to Apple including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Solution A.</strong> Allow Browser Engines Globally</li>
  <li><strong>Solution B.</strong> Two Binaries for One Bundle ID</li>
  <li><strong>Solution C.</strong> Global Dual Engine Binary with Toggle</li>

  <a class="header-anchor" href="#solution-a-allow-browser-engines-globally" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
  3.1.3.1.1. Solution A - Allow Browser Engines Globally
</h5>

<p>Apple could allow browsers to compete fairly with their own engines globally. This is
  the only option that would enable fair competition. <br><br>However we believe this is an unlikely option
  since:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The DMA has no ability to impose extra-jurisdictional remedies, and
    OWA is unaware of other legal mechanisms that could force this change.</li>
  <li>Apple’s revenue from Safari is reportedly $20B USD per year,
    an amount so significant that it’s unlikely Apple would willingly
    enable competition unless
    compelled.</li>
  <li>Enabling browser competition on iOS globally in the provision of
    features of Web Apps, will increase Web Apps ability to contest the
    Apple’s app store which is a
    significant source of revenue for Apple.</li>
</ol>

<p>The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority noted both of these potential motives
  for Apple’s rule locking browsers to the WKWebView in their report.</p>


<blockquote>
  <p><strong class="stressed">
      Apple receives significant revenue from Google by setting Google Search as the
      default search engine on Safari</strong>, and therefore benefits financially from high
    usage of Safari. Safari has a strong advantage on iOS over other browsers
    because it is pre-installed and set as
    the default browser. The WebKit restriction may help to entrench this
    position by limiting the scope for other
    browsers on iOS to differentiate themselves from Safari (for example
    being less able to accelerate the speed of
    page loading and not being able to display videos in formats not supported
    by WebKit). As a result, it is less
    likely that users will choose other browsers over Safari, which in turn
    secures Apple’s revenues from
    Google.</p>
  <p>Apple generates revenue through its App Store, both by charging developers for
    access to the App Store and by taking a commission for payments made via
    Apple IAP. Apple therefore benefits from
    higher usage of native apps on iOS. By requiring all browsers on iOS to
    use the WebKit browser engine,
    <strong class="stressed">Apple is able to exert control over the maximum
      functionality of all browsers on
      iOS</strong> and, as a consequence, hold up the development and use of web apps. This
    limits the <strong class="stressed">competitive constraint that web apps</strong>
    pose on native apps,
    which in turn protects and benefits Apple’s App Store revenues.

<p>The reason we have included this as an option is that by providing it as the best and
  most reasonable option from a competition point of view. It gives us a frame of reference for Apple’s other
  options. The other options, while possibly legal, are still anti-competitive and place competing vendors under
  significant burden.</p>

  <a class="header-anchor" href="#solution-b-two-binaries-for-one-bundle-id" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
  3.1.3.1.2. Solution B - Two Binaries for One Bundle ID
</h5>

<p>Allow browser vendors to provide two signed binaries under one application (one bundle
  id). These two binaries would be:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>One -</strong> A signed binary which contains the real browser with its
      own engine to ship to the EU and other jurisdictions that mandate Apple allow
      browsers be able to choose and
      modify their engine. This would need to include the ability to do A/B testing
      with WKWebView outlined <a href="#must-not-use-browser-engine-of-operating-system">above</a>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Two - </strong> A signed binary which contains the version of the
      browser which is forced to use Apple’s WKWebView which can be shipped
      in other jurisdictions.<br><br>An
      update mechanism that can then toggle which binary to deliver based on
      if the end user is an EU resident. This
      would likely require some development work on Apple's part to update
      their distribution mechanism and to
      ensure that both binaries can continue to access user data.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>One problem with this solution is the question of what happens when users become or
    cease to be EU residents. This would necessitate a complex swap over procedure
    by the browser vendors where local
    storage data is copied from one version of the browser to another. This could
    be a significant source of bugs.</p>

  <h5 id="solution-c-global-dual-engine-binary-with-toggle">
    <a class="header-anchor" href="#solution-c-global-dual-engine-binary-with-toggle" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
    3.1.3.1.3. Solution C - Global Dual Engine Binary with Toggle
  </h5>

  <p>Allow browser vendors to ship a single binary globally which contains both the browser
    vendor's own engine and the WKWebView version. For regulatory jurisdictions that haven’t yet forced
    Apple to allow competition, the browser would use the WKWebView, and for those who have, the browser would use the
    browser's own engine. Apple can indicate to the browser app whether they are allowed to use their own
    engine, and based on that the browser could then decide if they wish to use their own engine. Likely only a
    small technical change would be required for this solution to work. That is for Apple to provide some mechanism to
    let browser vendors detect whether they can use their engine or not, as legally required. Aside from that this
    would likely require no technical changes on Apple’s end, they would simply need to update their contracts
    to allow it. In the event Apple is unwilling to develop such an API, Apple can simply update their contracts and
    each browser vendor can detect whether a user is an EU resident to the best of their abilities using their own
    mechanisms such as IP address.
  </p>

  <p>
    The downside to this solution for browser vendors is that they would then be forced to
    ship an additional 60 MB &nbsp;- 70 MB (OWA’s estimate) to many millions of users who would not be able to
    use that engine due to Apple’s browser engine restrictions. This would then have an effect on user
    acquisition and retention rates as well as those users’ data usage.
  </p>

  <p>We recommend that the Commission reach out to the vendors to ask their opinions, and
    whether this solution would be feasible, if required to distribute a single global
    binary.
  </p>

  <h4 id="c3-summary">
    <a class="header-anchor" href="#c3-summary" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
    3.1.3.2. Summary
  </h4>

  <p>It is not acceptable for Apple to use their mechanics of restricting browser engines to the EU to
    suppress and undermine browser competition in the EU. If Apple can not be compelled to allow browser competition
    globally on iOS, they should be compelled to make browser competition on iOS within the
    EU <strong>at least</strong> minimally viable. The aim should be to allow third party browser
    vendors to effectively contest Safari’s features, performance, security and privacy on a fair playing field.
  </p>

  <p>The commission does not need to force Apple to do anything outside of the EU. The
    commission simply needs to compel Apple to allow browser vendors to update their existing browser apps for EU
    customers to use their own engine, if Apple wishes to implement a complex solution to geolock that to the EU, that
    is Apple’s choice, not the Commissions. Solutions A and Solution C are both straightforward ways in which
    Apple could achieve a fairer result with minimal technical work.</p>

  <p>These rules appear reasonable <strong>on the provision that Safari must equally
      abide by them</strong>. For these rules, the current level of security of Safari and Apple's

  <p>Apple strongly relies on app store review as a mechanism to protect users from iOSs weaker
    sandbox for Native Apps. Apple has placed great trust in “app review”, despite the fact they
    reportedly only employ a

      500 reviewers</a>. These reviewers are expected to review 100,000+ Native Apps per week,

    of malicious apps.

  <p>It doesn’t even appear to be effective in picking up apps that violate Apple’s payment

  <p>This suggests that while Apple outwardly projects confidence in the value of their app
    store review some informed insiders view it as worthless. </p>

  <p>Browsers use a far more reliable form of security than brief human review upon update.
    They lockdown the entire environment that the third party code, that is websites and Web Apps, runs in. This
    environment is called a sandbox and every action a website takes is tightly controlled. Even Apple acknowledges
    that browsers sandbox is massively superior to iOS’s sandbox for native apps:</p>

    <p>WebKit’s sandbox profile on iOS is orders of magnitude more
      stringent than the sandbox for native iOS apps.”</p>

  <p>Thus while we agree that the standard browsers should be held to a higher standard than
    that of a typical native app, it is critical that any security threat that browsers face be viewed holistically
    and not in isolation. That is, were the user forced to install a native app to use that functionality, instead of
    using a website or Web App what would their relative risk be. Would it be significantly better or worse.
  </p>

  <p>For example, if a browser implements a relatively secure, but not perfect,
    implementation of WebBluetooth, then its level of security should be compared to the current accepted level of
    security for native iOS apps that iOS already meets in their own CoreBluetooth implementation, not the
    hypothetical perfect security that Safari's non-existent WebBluetooth implementation would like to
    obtain.</p>

  <p>Security is a subtle art and many of these rules are by necessity subjective. For
    example “best practices” is no doubt a subject of fierce disagreement on certain points. As such,
    Apple should only be able to focus on points where there is broad agreement in the industry that certain practices
    are categorically and unambiguously bad.</p>

  <p>Any complaint by Apple based on violation of these rules should be necessary,
    reasonable, proportionate and justified with extensive evidence by Apple.</p>

  <p>In some cases there may be more than one method to mitigate a threat and browser
    engines’ very design may dictate how a browser defends against a particular threat. It is important
    therefore that Apple’s rules do not force browsers to mitigate each threat in specific ways but rather focus
    on the degree to which each browser has effectively mitigated a threat. In some cases there will be broad
    agreement between browsers on how to mitigate particular threats, and in those cases the rules can be more
    specific.</p>

  <p>Apple should be very specific about which rule has been broken and its evidence for why
    it believes that is the case. Apple’s current app review approach where apps are rejected without citing
    specific rules or clearly outlining why, is unacceptable here.</p>

  <p>Browser vendors should be consulted on each individual rule to see if they jointly
    agree that all the conditions are reasonable before settling on the final list.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>What Apple is saying here, is that if an API has a vulnerability, no matter how minor
    and no matter how much effort the browser vendor has taken to mitigate the vulnerability, Apple can demand that
    they remove the browser API. This is not reasonable, proportionate, strictly necessary and Apple is not offering
    to justify its decisions. All APIs contain the potential for vulnerabilities. Further, Apple would never accept an
    equivalent clause for its own apps or browser. </p>

  <p>This is particularly important as the primary reason that the DMA grants browsers the
    right to use their own browser engine is to prevent gatekeepers (such as Apple) from determining the functionality
    and standards for third-party browsers. Allowing Apple to ban third-party browsers from offering functionality on
    flimsy (or non-existent) security justifications would severely undermine this goal.</p>

  <p>This appears to grant Apple broad powers to use unnecessary and disproportionate
    security measures to block rival browsers from providing functionality that is distinct from Safari, preventing
    one of the core aims of the act in allowing browser vendors to port their own engines. It is critical that
    browsers are allowed to bring functionality to enable browsers and Web Apps to compete with the software and
    services of the gatekeepers including their native app ecosystems. If Apple is allowed to block functionality then
    it will prevent this competition. Apple should not be able to impose any security rules that would outright
    preclude browser vendors from porting such functionality, especially when considering that 5(7) does not have any
    security carve-outs.</p>

  <p>Additionally, in general, under 6(7), security terms which are not strictly necessary
    or proportionate must be removed or be modified to be in compliance with the act.</p>

  <p>There is always a trade off between security and utility. The safest browser would be
    one that refuses to open. The key here for browser vendors is to offer as much security as reasonably possible for
    their chosen level of utility. No browser should be compelled to reduce utility in the name of security if they
    have taken firm efforts to mitigate risks.</p>

  <p>We believe this is reasonable on the proviso that Apple also abides by it when
    publishing updates to Safari. Safari should not have any privileged status with regards to which security
    vulnerabilities it publishes or the manner in which it publishes them. An obligation for competitors to publish
    security vulnerabilities while exempting Apple from the same obligation would provide a significant unfair
    competitive advantage to Apple. </p>

    largest native Apps in the world, being the equivalents of Facebook and Uber in China. WeChat, for example, has

    <p>Although 5(7) does not contain carve-outs for security measures, we believe that it
      would be proportional under the act to require browsers to meet security standards providing it doesn’t
      prevent the browsers from porting their engines, and prevent them from implementing functionality. The language
      under Article 6(7) of the DMA states that Apple must duly justify any security measures, which Apple should do
      for
      5(7).</p>

    <p>Apple has not attempted to provide any justification to any of the rules in their
      browser entitlement contract or rules found in documents or contracts it pulls in under "Apple
      Materials''. We believe that Apple should be required to provide very detailed security justifications
      for
      each individual rule attached to obtaining this API access; Why is it strictly necessary and proportionate to
      prevent this access from compromising the integrity of the operating system, hardware or software features
      provided by Apple as per the wording and intent of the act.</p>

    <p>It is important that Apple publicly publish these justifications so that they can be
      scrutinized by the browser development and developer community to make sure that Apple is not attempting to use
      security rules to undermine either the DMA or competition to their benefit, nor to EU consumers and business
      users' detriment. This will allow the browser development and developer community to provide evidence and
      feedback as to if each rule is reasonable and whether Apple's explanation as to its necessity and
      proportionality are credible.</p>

    <p>We support Apple having the ability to remove browsers that are either malicious or
      consistently fail to meet a reasonable security standard clearly laid out in the rules (i.e patching regularly,
      fixing vulnerabilities in a timely fashion, etc). However, we believe Apple should need to prove any allegations
      with evidence and should face consequences for frivolous or unjustified removal of browsers.</p>

    <p>Apple appears to conflate other rules and terms into their contract for API access via
      the term “Apple Materials”. </p>

    <p>It is defined in the contract as:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&lsquo;Apple Materials&rsquo; means the Documentation, Entitlement
        Profile, and other materials provided by Apple to You, and which are incorporated by reference into the
        requirements of this Addendum.</p>

        </cite>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This is a frustratingly vague term. </p>

    <p>Apple also state in the contract that they can not guarantee the availability,
      completeness, or accuracy of Apple Materials. Given this term encompasses all potential rules the browser vendor
      must abide by it is critical that these are available, clear, complete and accurate. Browser vendors (and likely
      regulators) should be made aware of any plan to update them well in advance. Changes should be then subject to
      scrutiny by the Commission, browser vendors and third parties such as OWA.</p>

    <p>From their definition, it appears to encompass all documentation related to third-party browser
      engines, any documentation those documents reference,
      <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1718648881343684&usg=AOvVaw204j-5Q8r67EPfVBmVnEJI">

        Apple App Store Review Guidelines</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Further, the contract explicitly states on multiple occasions that signing and abiding by the
      terms in Apple Developer Program License Agreement is required to use these APIs, indeed this contract is
      structured as an addendum to the
      <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1718648881344392&usg=AOvVaw19-W8q7lywCR4eMttGNnwD">
        Apple Developer Program License Agreement</a>.
    </p>

    <p>These combined documents contain a vast number of non-security terms and are
      inappropriately referenced in the context of a browser that is not distributed via Apple’s app
      store.
    </p>

    <p>As such these viral terms must be removed and Apple should clearly present all security
      rules that they wish third-party browser vendors to abide by in order to access APIs necessary for building iOS
      browsers.</p>

    <p>Again “Apple Materials” is problematic as it conflates together various
      concepts that need to be separate.</p>

    <p>It is defined in the contract as:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><span>‘Apple Materials’ means the Documentation, Entitlement
          Profile, and other materials provided by Apple to You, and which are incorporated by reference into the

    <p>Specifically this means Apple Materials includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All documentation for the APIs</li>
      <li>The nature of how these APIs function and whether they exist</li>
      <li>All rules the browser vendor has to abide by</li>
      <li>Additional contractual terms</li>
      <li>Any other document referenced</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Specifically out of these, the rules which browser vendors need to abide by (which the
      act mandates can only be security rules) need to be separated out into their own term and in a single document
      which is available, clear, complete, accurate and up to date.</p>

    <p>Even ignoring Apple's insertion of non-security rules into its API contract, the fact that
      rules could be hidden in any of a vast range of non-explicitly defined documents,
      that <a href="#viral-terms">by Apple's own admission</a> may be incomplete or
      inaccurate and which they can change at any time without notification, means that staying in compliance becomes
      a
      fraught and unpredictable task for even the most diligent and security conscious of browser vendors. Even
      browser
      vendors with security significantly superior to Safari in all aspects could not be confident of being in
      compliance when the existing rules are unclear and changes in compliance requirements are not telegraphed in
      advance</p>

    <p>This is clearly not strictly necessary, reasonable or proportionate.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>That is, if Apple believes (note, Apple is not placing any burden of proof on itself
      here) that any rule has been broken in either this contract or in the developer agreement then they grant
      themselves the right to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Revoke access to the APIs</li>
      <li>Remove the browser engine entitlement from the browser</li>
      <li>Block updates or remove the browsers</li>
      <li>Block other applications the browser vendor distributes on Apple
        platforms</li>
      <li>Suspend or remove the developer from the Apple developer
        program</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Given the inherent vagueness of the rules that Apple is imposing here and Apple's long history
      of being a <a href="#direct-browser-installation">poor and self-serving judge of the
        implementation of those rules</a> this is an extremely threatening clause even to browser
      vendors who are competently doing an appropriate job of <q>protecting the
        integrity of the operating system, software and hardware of the gatekeeper</q>.</p>

    <p>This is not strictly necessary, proportionate or reasonable.</p>

    <p>While we support Apple's right to revoke access in cases of persistent negligence
      or significant and provable malice, this clause as it currently stands, will allow Apple to strategically and
      anti-competitively bully browser vendors over non-existant or minor edge cases.</p>

    <p>For example, as this rule stands, if Mozilla were to violate a non-security rule related to
      scrolling logic buried in a recently updated document on Apple's components, then under Apple’s
      contract, they would be able to block and remove Firefox from all Apple platforms including macOS. While we
      think
      this exact scenario is unlikely due to the regulatory scrutiny it would bring, it does highlight the power Apple
      is granting itself though this contract and how it subverts the intent of the DMA that the rules for API access
      be
      only security rules which are strictly necessary, proportionate and duly justified for
      <i><q>protecting the integrity of the operating system, software and hardware of the
        gatekeeper</q></i>.
    </p>


    <p>We believe this clause should be updated with language that impresses the necessity and
      proportionality of any response by Apple and place a burden on Apple to justify with evidence any punitive
      action
      it might take against any browser vendor.</p>

    </h3>

    <p>In Apple's browser engine entitlement contract they appear to obligate browser
      vendors to use iOS user interface libraries, rather than their own already built into Gecko and Blink.</p>

    <p>In their documentation for BrowserEngineKit they state:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>To correctly render CSS and manipulate the Javascript DOM, your browser app
        needs to integrate closely with UIKit and customize the way it handles many low-level user interface events.
        Use
        view classes in BrowserEngineKit to handle scrolling, drag interactions, and the context menu in your browser
        app.</p>

    <p>This becomes a rule and not a suggestion due to this clause in the contract:</p>

    <p>As discussed before, "Apple Materials" is a disconcertingly vague and broad
      term that in effect means any imperative statement in any documentation referenced from the contract or
      referenced
      from those documents in a cascade are considered binding rules.</p>

    <p>This is critical for two reasons. One, it means significant re-architecture of
      third-party browsers' engines. This is highlighted in this ticket from Google:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It's not entirely clear, but this seems to imply that existing browser
        rendering engines must be re-architected to fit the UIKit rendering model. Chromium has a large and
        sophisticated
        rendering architecture which is designed to be platform-agnostic, rather than rely on
        operating-system-specific
        details such as the OS compositing architecture. As such, complex behaviour like scrolling is implemented
        nearly
        identically across all non-iOS Chrome platforms including Windows, MacOS, Android, Linux and ChromeOS. Using
        an
        operating-system provided scrolling / compositing architecture is infeasible for Chromium both because of the
        huge
        engineering expense and also because it would result in a worse product
        in some ways.</p>

    <p>The second, is that it is in the implementation of these very user interface libraries
      that a not insignificant proportion of browser competition lies.</p>

    <p>Scrolling is a good example. Apple's implementation for scroll on iOS Safari has
      been riddled with bugs for any Web App that is attempting more 'app-like' layouts, that is ones where
      part
      of the page scrolls vertically rather than the entire page scrolling vertically.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>For more than 6 years, one of the biggest issues Web Developers have had to
        deal with in Safari and other WebKit-based browsers on iOS (and in a lesser extent on macOS), is the inability
        to
        reliably block body scroll, or, said in other words, to remove the ability to scroll the current page in
        certain
        situations.</p>
      <p>
        <cite>

            OWA - Proposed Interop Issue</a>
        </cite>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Apple appears unable or unwilling to fix these bugs, despite identical functionality
      working in almost every other browser for years. This has likely been prolonged by the complete lack of browser
      competition on iOS to apply pressure to fix these bugs or risk losing market share.</p>

    <p>Finally, Apple is only allowed to apply security rules in their API contract under
      Article 6(7), but even if they were to move these rules to their app store guidelines, they should still be
      struck
      out under Article 5(7), and Article 13(4) for preventing browsers from porting significant and key parts of
      their
      engines.</p>

    <p>It is essential that Apple does not constrain browsers from competing and bringing
      their full rendering stack (the rendering stack is the collection of libraries responsible for converting html,
      css and JavaScript into the displaying and updating the actual pixels on the screen inside the area controlled
      by
      the browser). Browser vendors should have the right, but not the obligation, to use these iOS provided user
      interface libraries and components as appropriate to their needs.</p>

    <p>This does not require Apple to make any technical changes. They simply have to update
      their contracts and associated documentation. Apple may state they do not intend to enforce these rules in their
      contract, but this is a misleading stance. Apple should not assert it has rights that are prohibited by the
      DMA.</p>

    <p>Apple is only allowed to apply strictly necessary, proportionate and duly justified for

        gatekeeper</q> on API access.
    </p>

    <p>While improving privacy is a laudable goal, we have three concerns with Apple's
      privacy section in their browser entitlement contract:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The browser entitlement contract is the wrong place to include these
        clauses as the DMA requires this to be limited to strictly necessary, proportionate and justified security
        related rules. All of these rules, at a minimum, will need to be moved to the app store guidelines.</li>

          apps distributed by its app store</a> —
        But extremely strong rules for browsers and
        Web Apps. This will create pressure for apps that are based on advertising to be distributed via Apple’s
        app store instead of the open web, as the former offers expanded access and weaker privacy protection for
        consumers.
      </li>
      <li>Any privacy rule in the app store guidelines must not, in effect, ban any of
        the existing major browsers from being ported, and thus contravene Article 5(7). Currently this would likely
        only impact Chrome. Chrome is in the process of phasing out third-party cookies
        <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pymnts.com/cpi-posts/uks-cma-raises-concerns-may-delay-googles-third-party-cookie-phase-out/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1718648881355994&usg=AOvVaw28RITYOAtO7qbGHBDcZ5wI">
          but has halted this while the UK's Competition and Market Authority reviews this
          change</a>. The CMA is concerned that the phase out of third-party cookies in Chrome and replacement with
        privacy sandbox will reduce competition in advertising. Apple must not apply any rule, that combined with this
        fact, would de facto ban Google from porting its browser to iOS. While as an organization we can see the
        privacy
        benefits of the phase out of third-party cookies and support it, it can not be used as a tool to block
        competitors from iOS. We would also be concerned at any attempt to fragment the functionality of browsers from
        jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>

    <p>We also note that Apple intends to apply privacy rules to apps that are not distributed
      by their app store but are signed/notarized by them. OWA considers Apple’s proposed notarization system
      for
      third party apps to be App Store Review, in all but name. Again while improving privacy is a laudable goal, we
      are
      concerned at the power this allows Apple to indiscriminately wield over apps that are not delivered though their
      app store. This is strictly prohibited by the DMA as the security carve outs in both 6(4) and 6(7) are both
      fairly
      narrowly scooped.</p>

    <p>The appropriate way for this issue to be dealt with is not to place this power in Apple's
      hands. Apple has a long and proven history of bending its own rules to act in its own financial interests even
      when that weakens or harms user privacy. Apple has also been shown to have

    <p>To solve the privacy issues, we would propose three solutions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Stronger privacy laws for the EU that would equally apply to native
        apps, Web Apps, websites and Apple's own apps.</li>
      <li>Apple taking steps to actually enforce a number of their privacy
        rules and abiding by them for their own apps. They could then advertise the privacy advantages of their app
        store over competitors or direct downloads. </li>
      <li>Apple should not use any word games to exclude themselves from their own
        privacy rules. For example Apple often refers to itself as a first party and displays different softer
        warnings
        or no warnings for similar behavior when Apple is the one collecting users data for the purposes of
        advertising.

    <p>In this case Apple is combining data from its app store (a core platform service of Apple) with
      other services of Apple including Apple News and Apple Stocks in order to perform targeted advertising. Whether
      this is in breach would likely depend on whether users were prompted and the nature of that consent prompt.

        Prior to iOS 15</a> users were not prompted and were automatically opted into targeted

        under investigation by the French Competition Authority</a>. They are investigating whether
      Apple is self preferencing by categorizing its behavior as it relates to advertising as special and thus under
      different rules to other third parties on iOS.
    </p>

    <p>Apple’s carefully chosen definition of “tracking” excludes its own
      behaviors from its privacy rules as they relate to targeted advertising. As Apple is both the operating system
      and
      the publisher of multiple Apple default apps, the app store is able to directly show targeted adverts without
      providing the applied data to a third-party. We believe this is an intentional redefinition of
      “tracking” to allow Apple to craft rules to allow its own use of targeted advertising whilst
      disallowing the same behavior in third parties.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong class="stressed">Apple does not consider the processing activities
          it undertakes in terms of personalised advertising (ie use of first-party data from different Apple apps and
          services) as ‘tracking’</strong>, particularly as it does not link information
        collected by apps from different companies, and therefore its apps are not required to show the ATT prompt.
        This
        is factually correct, given that, as detailed above, Apple uses data it collects from its own services which
        it
        operates under a single corporate ownership for personalised advertising purposes.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>6.177 However, as further discussed in Appendix J, based on our consideration of
        the ICO’s definition of online tracking, which does not distinguish between
        first-party and third-party data, we consider
        <strong class="stressed">Apple’s own use of its users'
          personal data no less consistent with this description of
          ‘tracking’ than that of third-party developers</strong>.

    <p>This line is problematic as it prohibits functionality that browsers already provide to
      users. For example, many browsers (including Safari) sync state between a user's mobile browser and their
      desktop browser. A lack of sync may prohibit other user-facing functionality, such as password autofill and tab
      syncing.</p>

    <p>As discussed in the previous section, Apple may only have strictly necessary,
      proportionate and justified security rules in their browser engine API contract, thus this rule would need to be
      moved to the app store rules. If Apple chooses to introduce this as an app store rule they would need to be more
      specific and be cautious so as not to block browser vendors from providing useful functionality to users,
      otherwise they risk violating Article 5(7).</p>

    <p>The EU courts, the Commission and other EU national authorities do not work for the

      states that such sharing of any non-public interactions with courts and regulators in the EU would be a
      violation
      of the contract.</p>

    <p>Apple should not attempt to grant itself confidentiality rights that it is already
      explicitly prohibited from granting by the DMA.</p>

    <p>This combination of an unreasonable and blanket ban on criticizing Apple’s app
      review process and a clause that Apple can use confidential information submitted to them for the purposes of

      store review in any way they see fit, including to compete against the very same app, again points to an

      explains that browser vendors are permitted to share such information about their interactions with Apple, to
      regulators and other government enforcement bodies in the EU.</p>

    <p>We would go further and argue it is unreasonable of Apple to hide malicious compliance
      of the DMA from the broader public via such confidentiality clauses and to obligate business users to release
      confidential information to Apple nominally for app store review, that Apple can then use for any purpose.
    </p>

    <p>Should browser vendors wish to talk to the press about Apple (for example) rejecting
      their browser for frivolous reasons, then they should be able to do so. Blocking public pressure, which
      facilitates the proper functioning of the DMA via NDAs or confidentiality agreements, should be
      prohibited.

    <p>This clause needs to be removed from the browser engine entitlement contract. Any
      similar clause in the app store rules should include language making it explicit that complaints to the
      Commission, EU courts and other EU legal bodies are permitted. In our opinion, it is not enough to simply state
      elsewhere that they will not enforce such action. The contracts themselves need to be compliant with the DMA.
      Further, if possible under any section of the DMA or any other applicable EU law, Apple’s confidentiality
      clauses should be scrutinized to make sure they are necessary, proportionate, fair and reasonable.</p>

    <p>This is clearly unreasonable, as the browser vendors need time to update their browser
      in order to make sure it continues to work despite the API change or removal.</p>

    <p>Next, Apple is obligated to make sure any software or hardware feature that is used, or
      available on the system, is provided to browser vendors free of charge subject to narrow scope security measures
      under Article 6(7).</p>

    <p>Apple is also not allowed under Article 5(7) or Article 13(4) to remove or alter any

      their
      engines to iOS.</p>

    <p>Finally, under Article 13(6) of the DMA, Apple is not allowed to degrade the conditions

    <p>That is, Apple can suspend any API from any individual browser vendor. Apple does not
      state they need to provide any evidence or rationale for such a suspension.</p>

    <p>Given that this contract is in essence exclusively for the EU, and Apple are even
      calling the app “Alternative Web Browser Engine (EU)”, and the DMA causes Apple to have an express
      obligation to provide and continue to provide these APIs to browser vendors subject to narrow scope security
      measures, Apple should not be attempting to override the DMA by contract. </p>

    <p>Apple in this clause states that, at its sole discretion, it can reject or remove a
      browser vendor's app from the app store for any reason.</p>

    <p>Again this is clearly not permissible under the DMA. Apple is required to operate its
      app store with FRAND (Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) conditions under Article 6(12). Further, it is
      not
      allowed to restrict browser vendors from using their own engines under Article 5(7). </p>

    <p>Any attempt to construct app store rules to prevent browsers from using their own
      engine in order to provide improved features, stability, security or privacy relative to Safari would likely be
      in
      violation of Article 13(4) for undermining Article 5(7).</p>

    <p>That is, rejecting a browser from Apple’s app store would not be at its sole
      discretion and it could not do it for any reason. Apple should not try to override the DMA via its contract and
      this paragraph should be modified to be compliant with the text of the DMA.</p>

    <p>While, in the short term, all browser vendors will likely want to be on Apple’s
      app store, it is not clear if this will remain the case. We would expect that over the long term many browser
      vendors will switch to direct distribution and no longer provide their apps via the Apple’s app
      store.</p>

    <p>Many developers do not distribute on Apple’s app store for macOS, as a point of
      comparison. </p>

    <p>Mere control of the app store review process, <a href="#apple-should-make-notarization-for-directly-downloaded-browsers-automatic">while of dubious and
        likely negative value in improving browser security</a>, does allow Apple to exert great
      control by holding up or rejecting app store updates. This exact
      concern is highlighted in the DOJs case against Apple. This means that the prospect of having users download
      signed apps directly from the browser vendors website using an automatic notarization system, similar to
      macOS, is
      likely quite appealing for browser vendors.</p>

    <blockquote>

    <p>For this reason it is quite concerning that Apple has chosen to make the contract for browser

    <p>In the opening paragraphs it states that:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Applications developed under this Agreement for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS,
        visionOS, and watchOS can be distributed: (1) through the App Store, if selected by Apple, (2) on a limited
        basis
        for use on Registered Devices (as defined below), and (3) for beta testing through TestFlight. Applications
        developed for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS can additionally be distributed through Custom App Distribution, if
        selected by Apple. Applications developed for macOS can additionally be separately distributed as described in
        this Agreement.</p>

    <p>Importantly, the only apps that can be distributed using this agreement outside
      Apple's app store or Apple's app store guidelines are applications for macOS:</p>

    <p><q>Applications developed for macOS can additionally be separately distributed as
        described in this Agreement.</q></p>

    <p>The agreement then has an entire section describing the rules for having your app
      notarized for macOS.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Apple may revoke Tickets at any time in its sole discretion in the event that
        Apple has reason to believe, or has reasonable suspicions, that Your Application contains malware or
        malicious,
        suspicious or harmful code or components or that Your developer identity signature has been

      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It is worth taking note that even in the instance where Apple has found that your app
      contains malware, this clause has lighter implications and is less broad than the one in Apple's contract
      for
      browser engine API access for potentially far more minor or dubious infractions. </p>

    <p>While this clause does have the phrase <q>in its sole
        discretion</q> it does at least make clear the nature of the infringement: That
      Apple would have reason to believe that app contains malicious code and that the penalty would simply be
      having
      that specific app unnotarized.</p>

    <p>Apple is required by the act to allow browser vendors to distribute directly and will
      only be subject to the strictly necessary, proportionate and justified security measures in 6(4) and 6(7). Thus,
      either the browser engine entitlement contract should be separate or the Apple Developer Program License
      Agreement
      should be updated with language making it clear that apps can be distributed directly and that any rules in the
      Apple Developer Program License Agreement or associated documents do not apply to them. Instead, only a clearly
      listed set of security rules would apply.</p>

    <p>The act explains that gatekeepers of operating systems can favor their own products by
      pre-installing them and setting them as the system default. One of the methods used by the act to help combat
      this
      self-preferencing is a choice screen for browsers on operating systems where the browser of the gatekeeper has
      been set as the default.</p>

    <p>No choice screen will ever completely nullify the advantage granted to the gatekeeper
      by setting the default browser. In order to have maximum impact in minimizing the effect of this
      self-preferencing, to increase user autonomy and to not introduce new self-preferencing via the choice screen
      itself, the choice screen must be carefully designed. Apple’s choice screen, while much improved from
      initial proposals, still has significant issues.</p>

    <p>While this document focuses only on Apple, in most cases we recommend equivalent
      remedies for Google’s Android.</p>

      3.2.1. Browsers should Be Allowed To Show More Information on Choice Screen
    </h3>

    <p>Currently on iOS the amount of information that browser vendors can show on the choice
      screen is extremely limited. It is limited to the company's name, browser name and browser logo.</p>

    <p>One of the aims of the act with the choice screen is to allow users to make an informed
      choice and to limit the degree to which operating system gatekeepers can self-preference their own browser by
      setting it as the default.</p>

    <p>With this in mind, it seems entirely appropriate that Apple allow browser vendors to
      display a sentence explaining why users should choose their browser. The layout should be updated to allow the
      full sentence to be displayed without clicking on any buttons, a more reasonable character limit might be 150
      characters (about 30 words).</p>

    <p>To do otherwise concentrates power in the hands of major browsers and suppresses

    <p>Multi-homing is where an end user or business user uses multiple core-platform
      services. For example owning an Android phone and an iOS iPad. It could also be having multiple apps on a phone
      from different distributors such as different app stores or directly from the business user (i.e. direct
      download
      / distribution via the web).</p>

    <p>The act specifically highlights direct distribution, in this case downloading and
      updating directly from the business users own website, as something business users should have the option of
      choosing for their users. Should a browser vendor wish to distribute to their users directly via their own
      website
      (as opposed to Apple’s app store), they should be able to do so.</p>

    <p>Choice screens aim to nullify the way that operating system gatekeepers self-preference
      themselves via setting defaults on the operating system. This remedy should not then reinforce the dependence on
      the core platform services of gatekeepers, in particular their app store.</p>

    <p>There are a number of concerns here:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Apple is only counting browsers downloaded from their app stores in
        the calculation of the 12 most popular browsers. Browsers that are downloaded directly or from another app
        store need to be included in this count.</li>
      <li>Browsers that are not available on the gatekeepers app store at all
        still need to be included.</li>
      <li>Browser vendors should not be locked to the gatekeepers app store
        and should be able to opt into distributing directly to users. Given that all of Apple's security checks
        are built into their browser entitlement contract and notarization process, there is absolutely no plausible
        reason to introduce scare screens, and doing so would, in our opinion, be a violation of the act.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To allow Apple to impose their app store as the sole gateway for downloading browsers
      via the choice screen or even the default is against the intent of the act.</p>

    <p>These changes are critical to browser competition on mobile operating systems. In the
      same manner that it would have been ridiculous for Microsoft to tie their choice screen to only browsers on a
      Microsoft store from which they set the rules and get a 30% cut, it is unreasonable for Apple to tie their
      choice
      screen to their app stores along with their rules and their up to 30% cut.</p>

    <p>Without allowing browser vendors chosen via the choice screen to be directly downloaded
      from the browser vendor themselves, and instead forcing them to use the Apple’s app store, will continue
      to
      damage browser competition including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Forcing browser vendors to share 30% of all revenue made via
        in-app purchases, which would effectively kill various business models or significantly reduce browser revenue
        (i.e. for purchases of VPNs, or subscriptions to AI assistants).</li>
      <li>Forcing all browser vendors to accept the gatekeeper’s app
        store rules and conditions, which are well documented to be unfair and hamper competition.</li>
      <li>Introduces delays and complexity into planning and releases.</li>
    </ul>

      3.2.3. Should be a Background and Direct Download
    </h3>

    <p>As discussed in the previous section, taking the user to the app store is an
      inappropriate flow, it also introduces friction relative to the gatekeepers browser which is
      preinstalled.
    </p>

    <p>Instead, the user should simply pick their new default browser from the choice screen
      and the operating system should download and install the browser in the background. The choice screen should
      allow
      the browser vendor to show relevant information about their browser, including pictures and videos that the user
      can see by clicking on a “see more” arrow icon. </p>

    <p>This design works far better when different browsers are coming from different
      distribution channels such as directly from the browser vendors website. Both Google and Apple's design
      currently conflict with this requirement and will need to be reworked.</p>

    <p>Next, Apple appears to have recently added a time to download countdown to the Apple
      app store page.</p>

    <figure>
      <img alt="" src="/images/apple-dma-report/image4.png">
      <figcaption>The Choice Screen when Brave has been selected and
        the download symbol has
        been pressed. Note the “cancel” button at the top
        and the install time widget that Apple has
        added.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We believe that this, in combination with the prominent cancel button, is an attempt by
      Apple to use the fact they are preinstalled to undermine user autonomy and push users towards Safari.</p>

    <p>Instead of having a countdown, we believe that Apple should simply set that browser as
      the default browser immediately, continue to the homescreen, and replace Safari on the hotseat with the user
      selected browser. It will be clear to the user that the browser is downloading, as it will have the standard
      downloading circle on the hotseat. We believe after this process has been started, it should continue until it
      has
      finished. Providing an additional cancel option undermines the choice screen.</p>

      3.2.4. Browser Vendors Need Data on the Choice Screen to Measure Performance
    </h3>

    <p>Third party browser vendors need access to the number of times their browser was shown
      and the number of times their browser was picked on the choice screen by end users. This data can be aggregated
      per country per day. Additionally it would be useful to include additional information, such as the position in
      the choice screen the browser was shown.</p>

    <p>For example one piece of aggregated data a browser vendor might receive could
      be:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Country:</dt>
      <dd>Germany</dd>
      <dt>Date:</dt>
      <dd>2024-07-01</dd>
      <dt>Browser:</dt>
      <dd>Firefox</dd>
      <dt>Times Shown:</dt>
      <dd>1451</dd>
      <dt>Times Selected:</dt>
      <dd>435</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>i.e. 1451 people were shown Firefox across all positions in Germany on 2024-07-01, out
      of them 435 chose to make Firefox the default browser.</p>

    <p>For the more detailed one that includes position an example would be:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Country:</dt>
      <dd>Germany</dd>
      <dt>Date:</dt>
      <dd>2024-07-01</dd>
      <dt>Browser:</dt>
      <dd>Firefox</dd>
      <dt>Times Shown:</dt>
      <dd>77</dd>
      <dt>Times Selected:</dt>
      <dd>5</dd>
      <dt>Position:</dt>
      <dd>12</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>i.e. 77 people were shown Firefox in the 12th position in Germany on 2024-07-01, out of
      them 5 chose to make Firefox the default browser.</p>

    <p>This is important to give browser vendors the chance to work out what works in
      advertising and adding features to their browser, as well as providing data that the remedy is effective.
    </p>

    <p>Given the data is aggregated and boils down to two numbers per country per day (or 24
      for the more detailed one), there is no plausible privacy or security reason not to collect or share this data.
      The only party that benefits from this data not being available is the operating system gatekeeper.</p>

    <p>The operating system gatekeeper benefits in two ways. First, third party browser
      vendors can not work out what blurb, advertising or features work in encouraging users to switch browsers.
      Second,
      the relative effectiveness of the choice screen is obscured.</p>

    <p>Given this data is aggregated and non-confidential in nature, gatekeepers should not be
      able to prevent browser vendors from publishing it if they choose to.</p>

    <p>Finally, whether or not a remedy is effective is clearly important to the DMA. For
      example in the event a gatekeeper is believed to have frustrated the objectives of an article, a proceeding can
      be
      opened. The gatekeeper can then be obligated to fix the behavior via commitments or be fined. In the event those
      commitments are not effective the proceeding can be reopened.</p>

        This can for

      <figcaption>The hotseat on iOS’s homescreen</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The <strong>hotseat</strong> is any of that collection of app
      locations on the dock on the base of iOS homescreen. They have the advantage of always being shown regardless
      of
      which homescreen the user is on. Apple has set Safari to be in the hotseat by default (along with phone,
      messages
      and Apple Music), while users can change this setting manually by dragging the item out and another in, Apple
      has
      added significant friction by not making this automatic.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Only about half (52%) of people understand that their default browser is
        opened when they, for example, click on a link in an email or document.</p>
      <p>[..]</p>
      <p>over half (53%) also erroneously believed that their default browser would
        automatically be pinned to their task-bar.</p>

      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Being selected as the default browser does not grant the hotseat. This means it is
      entirely possible, and in fact likely that many existing users who have set a third party browser as their
      default
      browser will still have Safari or Chrome on certain versions of Android in the hotseat.</p>

    <p>While this is of concern on both Android and iOS, due to the undermining of the meaning
      of default browser, an additional concern is introduced on iOS due to how Apple has implemented their choice
      screen.</p>

    <p>The DMA states this on choice screens:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This includes <strong class="stressed">prompting a choice screen, at the moment
          of the users’ first use of an</strong> online
        search engine, virtual assistant or <strong class="stressed">
          web browser of the gatekeeper</strong>

          <br>(emphasis added)
        </cite>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Apple has interpreted the DMA very directly here and will only show the choice screen
      upon Safari being clicked, unlike Google which does it immediately upon system software update.</p>

    <p>In Apple’s design, Safari’s interface actually loads and then the choice
      screen is a full screen overlay over Safari. This has the psychological effect of making the choice screen seem
      more like an interruption rather than part of the setup of the device. While this was more problematic in
      Apple’s initial design which included a giant skip button (labeled “not now”) at the bottom
      (which would essentially choose Safari), this still seems to be a nudge to users to quickly choose a browser and
      get back to their initial task.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>People are significantly more likely to choose a pre-installed browser as
        their default when the choice screen is shown at first use of the
        browser [...] from 11% to 19%</p>
      <p>
        <cite>
          <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://research.mozilla.org/files/2023/09/Can-browser-choice-screens-be-effective_-Mozilla-experiment-report.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1718648881404212&usg=AOvVaw0lCGCBNKUDZoKZXQ6z1ES6">

        </cite>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Apple's design then creates the problematic scenario where the choice screen will
      be shown even if Safari is not the default browser. Apple is clearly aware of this based on the careful phrasing
      of their speech at the workshop:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In terms of what's being required here by the DMA
        our focus is on <strong class="stressed">presenting this choice</strong> even more
        clearly to consumers <strong class="stressed">the first time you use Safari</strong>.
        Obviously there are not choices being presented when
        you use other browsers on iOS. So we are complying
        <strong class="stressed">from our perspective with the spirit here</strong>.

      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Showing the choice screen when Safari is not the default is clearly against the intent
      of the act and Apple needs to update the choice screen to only show if Safari is the default browser. The
      default
      browser not automatically granting the hotseat, significantly compounds and re-enforces this problem. While it
      is
      possible for users to manually change this, this style of friction significantly undermines browser competition.
      Operating system gatekeepers know this and this is precisely why they are so resistant to such a change.
    </p>

    <p>It should be assumed that because Apple has displayed the choice screen when third
      party browsers were already set as default, that they would have already gained users for Safari that they would
      otherwise not have.</p>

    <p>A reasonable remedy here would be to re-run the choice screen for all users that picked
      Safari upon such an inappropriate choice screen being shown. If Apple does not store that information, it can
      simply re-run the choice screen for all Safari users.</p>

      3.2.6. Periodic Choice Screens
    </h3>

    <p>The act aims to nullify the power operating system gatekeepers grant themselves by
      setting the defaults on the operating system. In particular, the "default browser" to their own and
      placing their browser in a prominent location by default.</p>

    <p>A one-off choice screen may have an impact, perhaps even a significant one, but that
      impact will fade and will not achieve this goal of the act. It therefore seems appropriate that the choice
      screen
      is re-shown to users at an appropriate interval. </p>

    <p>We believe then, that the choice screen should be shown whenever users encounter a new
      reinstallation event, such as purchasing a new phone, restoring from an old phone or a factory reset.</p>

    <p>This allows the choice screen to have a lasting impact. While it will not remove the
      immense self privilege of the defaults the operating system gatekeeper sets, it will at least make a significant
      dent. Critical mass is important for browsers as it strongly affects website developers’ interest in
      supporting them and dictates their funding, which dictates their development budget.</p>

    <p>We believe the act would support the display of choice screen on devices in which the
      user is either transferring or restoring their settings to that device. As of the time of writing this document
      (iOS 17.5), this is not implemented by Apple.</p>

        Apple added the ability to change it</a>. However as part of this update, Apple specifically coded
      the
      astonishing brazen dark pattern of hiding the option to change the
      default browser in Safari
      settings,<em>if Safari was already default</em>.
      If Safari was <em>not the

      4.1.1.1. Remove Non-Security Terms
    </h4>

    <p>Apple’s browser engine entitlement contract defines the conditions with which
      browser vendors must comply with to be granted access by Apple to hardware and software features on iOS. Article
      6(7) authorizes the gatekeeper to take such measures, but exclusively in order to preserve the security of the
      operating system.</p>

    <p>However, as discussed in <a href="#Apples-new-browser-engine-entitlement-contract">section
        3.1</a>, Apple has incorporated into this contract a vast number of rules that do not
      relate to security. These rules are therefore non-compliant with the DMA, and we recommend that Apple should
      be
      compelled to remove them.</p>

    <p><strong>Apple should remove all non-security-related rules from this contract</strong>.</p>

    </h4>

    <p>Apple will need to remove the following rule from its browser engine entitlement
      contract, and not add an equivalent rule elsewhere, such as in its app store guidelines:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>2.2 (page 1): “Be a separate binary from any Application that uses the
        system-provided web browser engine”</p>
      <p>

            Apple Browser Engine Entitlement Contract</a>
        </cite>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This rule is a significant barrier to browser vendors porting their real browsers to
      iOS and defacto causes them to lose all their EU users on their existing browser app on iOS.</p>

    <p>We cover this in greater depth in <a href="#must-not-use-browser-engine-of-operating-system">Section

      4.1.1.3. Allow Browser Vendors to keep their existing EU customers
    </h4>

    <p>Apple has chosen to restrict browser competition on iOS to the EU. Apple’s
      actions seek to force third-party browser vendors to build, develop, and maintain two versions of their apps for
      iOS while Apple’s own Safari bears no such costs.</p>

    <p>Apple’s rules appear to force browser vendors to ship a brand new version of
      their app in the EU, rather than update existing apps to use their own engines. This will cause browser vendors
      to
      lose existing customers, as consumers will need to manually download the new browser.</p>

    <p>This complexity and friction is a direct result of Apple’s own anti-competitive
      actions over the past 15 years. Apple’s insistence that competitors will only be allowed to compete on a
      level playing field (with their own engines) in the EU is already a high burden, and this rollout plan would
      levy
      additional transition costs on competitors. It is reasonable and proportionate that Apple takes steps to
      mitigate
      the damage they appear intent on causing. </p>

    <p>Forcing browser vendors to ship two distinct products in Europe will lead to end user
      confusion and significant harm to these browser vendors. We do not believe that such an approach would be either
      fair or compliant with the DMA.</p>

    <p>Apple should not be forcing browser vendors to reacquire existing users. Apple will
      need to implement a solution where browser vendors can use their own engines and keep their existing EU
      users.</p>

    <p>Specifically, we are seeking the Commission to compel Apple to allow browser vendors to
      update their apps for EU consumers to their own engines. With this remedy, we are not asking that the Commission
      compel Apple to make any changes outside the EU. It is between Apple and other global regulators if they add any
      complex code or logic to restrict browser competition on iOS to the EU.</p>

    <p>Apple has a number of options to comply with this remedy and have the opportunity to
      suggest other alternatives that may solve the underlying issue. They are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Solution A.</dt>
      <dd><a href="#solution-a-allow-browser-engines-globally">Allow Browser Engines Globally</a></dd>
      <dt>Solution B.</dt>

      <dt>Solution C.</dt>
      <dd><a href="#solution-c-global-dual-engine-binary-with-toggle">Global Dual Engine Binary with Toggle</a></dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Solution A and C would only require contract changes and the most minimal technical
      changes.</p>

    <p>Importantly, browser vendors need the right, but not the obligation, to use these

      4.1.1.5. Remove Viral Terms
    </h4>

    <p>“Apple Materials” is an inappropriately vague term that expands
      Apple’s Browser Engine Entitlement Contract to include a great many non-security rules. The way it is
      phrased is that any imperative statement in any document referenced from the contract or referenced from those
      documents in cascade is a binding rule.</p>

    <p>As this is purely a contract for API access, Apple is required to only have strictly
      necessary and proportionate rules to protect the integrity of the operating system. Apple is also required to
      justify all of these rules as being so.</p>

    <p>As such, these viral terms must be removed and Apple should clearly present all
      security rules that they wish third-party browser vendors to abide by in order to access APIs necessary for
      building iOS browsers, preferably in a single document.</p>

    <p>Any update to this document should be public and all relevant parties should be alerted
      to the new proposed changes. Barring exceptional circumstances, changes should be known by browser vendors and
      outside groups months in advance. </p>

    <p>All security rules for browser vendors must be clear and upfront.</p>

    <p>It is important that browser vendors can be confident they are abiding by all security
      rules. In the event that Apple wishes to introduce rules that are not strictly necessary, proportionate,
      justified
      or that violate Article 5(7) then browser vendors will need time to respond and, if appropriate, notify the
      Commission.</p>

    <p>Specifically, Apple must publish all security rules for browsers in a single document.
      Apple must commit to these rules being available, complete and accurate. In the event Apple wishes to update
      this
      document, it must notify all parties and give significant advanced warning of the exact changes it is making,
      and
      the justification of the necessity and proportionality of said changes. Apple will need to attest to the fact
      that
      the updated or new rules do not conflict with Article 5(7).</p>

      4.1.1.7. Justify All Security Rules
    </h4>

    <p>We believe that Apple should be required to provide a security justification for each
      individual rule attached to obtaining the API access required by browsers using their own engine: Why is it
      strictly necessary and proportionate to prevent this access from compromising the integrity of the operating
      system, hardware or software features provided by Apple as per the wording and intent of the act.</p>

    <p>Any rule that cannot be justified, or where the justification is inappropriate or
      insufficient, should be removed or modified.</p>

    <p>Apple’s current penalties, as described, do not take into account the need for
      proportionality. </p>

    <p>The phrase “in Apple’s sole discretion” is not consistent with the
      fact that Apple will need to justify each of its security measures. </p>

    <p>The language of the contract should be updated to make it clear that the penalties will
      be proportional and that Apple will provide detailed evidence and reasoning to support any penalty it might
      choose
      to impose.</p>

      4.1.1.9. Justify and Update Non-Proportionate Security
      Terms
    </h4>

    <p>Apple has granted itself the ability to force any browser vendor to remove any browser
      API that contains a vulnerability, no matter how minor and no matter how much effort the browser vendor has
      taken
      to mitigate the vulnerability.</p>

    <p>This is particularly important, as the primary reason that the DMA grants browsers the
      right to use their own browser engine is to prevent gatekeepers (such as Apple) from determining the
      functionality
      and standards for third-party browsers. Allowing Apple to ban third-party browsers from offering functionality
      on
      unjustified or non-existent security justifications would severely undermine this goal.</p>

    <p>This appears to grant Apple broad powers to use unnecessary and disproportionate
      security measures to block rival browsers from providing functionality that is distinct from Safari, preventing
      one of the core aims of the act in allowing browser vendors to port their own engines.</p>

    <p>This clause must be removed or modified to be strictly necessary and proportionate.
      Apple must be required to provide clear and convincing evidence of necessity and proportionality of any
      individual
      execution of such a rule.</p>

      4.1.1.10. Security Disclosure
    </h4>

    <p>Apple has proposed a security disclosure requirement in their browser engine API
      contract. We welcome this security disclosure policy, provided it applies equally to Safari. Our concern is that
      if Apple can avoid full disclosure while, at the same time, compelling other vendors to disclose
      vulnerabilities,
      Apple may use these disclosures to falsely claim superior security or create a pretense for delisting other
      browsers from their app store. Our recommendation would be for Apple to keep this policy but to also abide by it
      for their own browser.</p>

      4.1.2. Safari and other Apple Services get Special Placement
    </h3>

    <p>On the settings page for iOS, pre-installed Apple apps are not placed with the other apps. Instead
      they are given a special, far more prominent location, in the settings. Other third-party apps are shown in a
      separate location further down the settings page. This divide suggests to
      users that these are <em>official</em>apps they <em>should</em> be
      using (which come pre-installed) and other apps are “alternative apps”.</p>

    <p>These apps include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Siri</li>
      <li>Apple App Store</li>
      <li>Wallet and Apple Pay</li>
      <li>Mail</li>
      <li>Contacts</li>
      <li>Calendar</li>
      <li>Notes</li>
      <li>Reminders</li>

      <li>Phone</li>
      <li>Messages</li>
      <li>FaceTime</li>
      <li>Safari</li>
      <li>Stocks</li>
      <li>Weather</li>
      <li>Translate</li>
      <li>Apple Maps</li>

      <li>Books</li>
      <li>Podcasts</li>
      <li>Game Center</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It indicates to the user that these apps are special and that, while it may be
      mechanically possible for some of these apps to be replaced by third party apps, the non-neutral nature of the
      interface arguably seeks to dissuade users from changing the default.</p>

    <p>In particular the fact that Safari has a separate and elevated position from other
      browsers is, we believe, in contravention of Article 6(3), Article 13(6) and Recital 70 which state:</p>

    <p>Apple should move all of its apps and third party apps into the same location in
      settings. In the event particular types of apps are of elevated importance such as app store, browser, photos,

    <p>Importantly, the WKWebView and SFSafariViewController should be treated as system components, and
      it should not be possible to uninstall them. Both of these components are used in a wide variety of native apps.
      Many native apps use the WKWebView as a convenient way to render first/second party content and any remedy which
      would break these apps would be unreasonable, disproportionate and counter-productive. Other apps use
      SFSafariViewController when the user clicks on an external http/https link and should be allowed to continue to
      do
      so, provided <a href="#sfsafariviewcontroller-must-respect-browser-choice">Apple commits to making

    <p>We would also support it not being possible to uninstall the default browser until a

    <p>We are uncertain if SFSafariViewController is built on top of Safari or the WKWebView.
      In the event it is currently built on the WKWebView it is not a blocker to Safari being fully uninstallable.

    <p>In the event it is currently mechanically bound to Safari it will need to be updated to instead

      In the (likely rare) instance that the user's chosen default browser does not support interoperating with

        different software applications and services that are accessed using the core platform services of the
        gatekeeper.</q></p>

    <p>iOS and Safari are both implicated in delivering Web Apps, and both are designated core
      platform services. Via its control of both iOS and Safari, Apple has long denied Web Apps the ability to prompt
      the user to be installed, adding great friction to the process of installing them. Instead, the option to
      install
      a Web App is hidden away in a hard to find “share” menu option. Competing browser vendors were only
      provided with access to this share menu function last year, and are still denied access to the necessary APIs
      within WKWebView to implement the ability for websites to enable such user-driven prompts.</p>

    <p>Apple has implemented many pieces of equivalent functionality to install native apps from their
      own app store via Safari, including but not limited to <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open-web-advocacy.org/walled-gardens-report/%23app-clips&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1718648881430288&usg=AOvVaw0jcNHZRQcePrdPl4VAVOof">App

        Banners</a>.</p>

    <p>Due to the manner in which WKWebView-based browsers on iOS are implemented, only Apple
      can effectively implement install prompts for them, and has steadfastly refused to do so despite consistent
      developer requests.</p>

    <p>We believe that Apple should be obligated to implement install prompts, including both
      automatic prompts (akin to Smart Banners) and the ability to programmatically display prompts on a button click
      from within websites that meet the minimum criteria for installation (e.g., providing a Web App Manifest). Apple
      should also implement APIs already in use across the web to facilitate control over this behavior
      (“onbeforeinstallprompt”). onbeforeinstallprompt is the technical term for the current
      implementation,
      it is an event that tells developers that it is possible to install the website as a web app, this means they
      can
      add a button to the page that will trigger showing the choice to the user. This allows developers to create
      their
      own install buttons.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The beforeinstallprompt event fires when the browser has detected that a
        website can be installed as a Progressive Web App.</p>
      <p>There's no guaranteed time this event is fired, but it usually happens on page
        load.</p>

    <p>Given that Apple has withheld this functionality for almost a decade, we believe that
      Apple should not be able to delay discussions of the specifications as this could take months or even years.
      Rather, they should implement the current specification as is currently available in other browsers which
      support
      the feature. After implementing the functionality, Apple can then propose any updates or upgrades.</p>

    <p>Apple should not be allowed to add additional scare screens or other friction as it is
      not necessary from a security perspective. The ability to install Web Apps via iOS Safari has been available for
      almost 15 years without such measures, and Apple has not felt it was necessary to implement such measures. They
      surely cannot be justified now, particularly after Apple’s strong claims regarding the security of its iOS
      Web App container.</p>

    <p>Web Apps are protected by the sandbox of the browser, which

        states</a> is <q>&gt;orders of magnitude more stringent than the
        sandbox for Native Apps</q>. This is important as it means that Apple does not have any
      significant unmitigatable security objections to such a change.

      4.1.5. App Store Rules for Browsers Must Be Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND)
    </h3>

    <p>Apple may be tempted to move proposed non-security rules regarding browsers from its
      proposed browser engine entitlement contract to the broader app store guidelines, which it includes by reference
      within the proposed Browser Engine Entitlement Addendum. By phrasing the browser engine contract as an addendum,
      rather than a stand-alone contract, the terms of the entire “Apple Developer Program License
      Agreement” is included.</p>

    <p>A number of the rules within the engine entitlement addendum do not appear to be fair
      or reasonable, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>That the browser must be solely distributed in the EU</li>
      <li>The browser must be a separate binary from one that uses the systems
        browser engine</li>
      <li>Apple may change the rules at any time with no notice</li>
      <li>Apple makes no guarantees as to the accuracy of the rules</li>
      <li>Apple can reject browsers for any reason at its sole
        discretion</li>
      <li>Apple can remove, suspend, break any API with no notice</li>
      <li>Any breach of rules, no matter how minor, will allow Apple to block
        or remove your application from all Apple platforms including macOS</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Apple should not be allowed to add rules for browsers to the app store guidelines or
      apple program developer license that are unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory.</p>

    <p>While we recognise that the DMA may not have the ability to compel Apple to allow
      browsers to compete fairly on iOS globally, the unfairness of keeping this privilege exclusive to Safari (out of
      browsers which ship their own engine) should be noted. The EU should consider any remedies available to lessen
      this unfairness.</p>

    <h3 id="app-store-rules-for-browsers-must-not-violate-article-5-7-and-recital-43">

      4.1.6. App Store Rules for Browsers Must Not Violate Article 5(7) and Recital 43
    </h3>

    <p>Under Article 5(7), Apple can not impose a browser engine on competing browsers. The
      aim here outlined in Recital 43 is to prevent gatekeepers (such as Apple) from determining the functionality and
      standards of rival browsers by imposing a browser engine.</p>

    <p>That is, browser vendors must be free to compete in features, stability, security and
      privacy. Under Article 13(4) Apple can not construct alternative rules or OS design choices that would undermine
      and render Article 5(7) ineffective.</p>

    <p>So any rule, including rules moved from Apple’s browser engine entitlement
      contract into Apple’s app store rules, Apple developer program license contract or rules in documents
      included by reference must be compliant with Article 5(7).</p>

      4.1.7. Testing for Browser Vendors and Developers Outside the EU
    </h3>

    <p>Under Apple’s current proposal, browser vendors and companies that develop
      websites for the EU, whose development teams are outside the EU, will be unable to test their websites or Web
      Apps
      in browsers on iOS that use their own engine - except for Safari. Apple's Safari will be the only browser
      which uses its own engine that will be available globally.</p>

    <p>Apple's browser engine entitlement contract makes no exception for test devices in
      its rule that browsers using their own engine (other than Safari) must only be available (on iOS) in the EU.
      Apple’s technical restrictions, launched as part of iOS 17.4, further indicate hostility towards
      reasonable
      exceptions for development and testing, with the OS using multiple mechanisms to geofence access to EU-specific
      behavior to devices physically within the EU.</p>

    <p>For Browser Vendors, the contract is less clear. It does reference “Authorized Test
      Units” but offers no clarification. In practice, Apple appears to have a policy that all test units for
      browser vendors must be physically located&nbsp;in the EU.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The Register has learned from those involved in the browser trade that
        <strong class="stressed">
          Apple has limited the development and testing of third-party browser engines to devices
          physically located in the EU</strong>. That requirement adds an additional barrier to anyone
        planning to develop and support a browser with an alternative engine in the EU.It effectively geofences
        the development team. Browser-makers whose dev teams are located in the US will only be able to work on
        simulators. While some testing can be done in a simulator, there's no substitute for testing on device
        –
        which means developers will have to work within Apple's prescribed
        geographical boundary.
      </p>
      <p>‘The contract terms are bonkers and almost no vendor I'm
        aware of will agree to them,’ lamented one industry veteran familiar with the making of browsers in
        response
        to an inquiry from The Register.</p>
      <p>‘Even folks that may have signed something to be able to prototype can't
        ship under the constraints Apple's trying to impose. They're so broad and sweeping as to try to duck
        most
        of the DMA by contract … which is certainly bold.’</p>

    <p>This places browser vendors and web developers attempting to reach EU customers via the
      web at a significant disadvantage that Apple and Safari are not subject too. This greatly harms the goals of
      interoperability and competition that the DMA sets out to allow.</p>

    <p>This will harm EU end users by making these browsers less secure due to the inability
      for any engineering team, geographically outside of the EU, being able to develop and test their products
      accurately. Some, perhaps even most, browser vendors hire security experts from all around the world and some
      security bugs (like JIT bugs) will need a real device to test and debug on. Not only would this put EU users at
      risk, but it would also unfairly disadvantage the competing browser vendors.</p>

    <p>Is it really reasonable for Apple to in effect force the entire development teams of
      these mobile browsers to relocate to the EU? Would Apple accept a similar requirement for their own products in
      another jurisdiction?
    </p><p>This also prohibits automated on-device tests for browser vendors outside the EU.
      Again, the end result of this will be poorer quality products as a result of Apple’s unreasonable
      restriction.</p>

    <p>Finally, of the millions of web developers and businesses outside the EU who serve EU
      customers, but do not live in the EU, should Apple really be able to make it impossible for them to effectively
      test their software on competing browsers?</p>

    <p>We had hoped that Apple might reasonably foresee these complications and voluntarily
      cease this continued anti-competitive behavior and make it possible for developers to test their products
      outside
      of the EU. Unfortunately, Apple seems content with making the web less interoperable and more difficult to
      develop
      for.</p>

    <p>As the DMA is (likely) unable to compel Apple to allow browser vendors to compete on
      iOS with their own engines globally, we propose two potential solutions: </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Relax the requirements on test devices so that browser vendors can
        at least test their own browsers on test devices outside the EU. This seems an extremely reasonable request
        and
        Apple has no reason beyond malice and a belief they can’t legally be forced to do so to not comply with
        it. If Apple believes it does have legitimate reasons it should publicly publish them so they can be
        scrutinized. This part of the remedy solves the problem for allowing browser vendors to develop and test their
        products.In the case that this scenario is actually a mistake on Apple’s part, and is just a lack
        of foresight on the needs of developers in regards to testing, Apple should issue updated guidance that
        browser
        vendor test devices are exempt from this policy.</li>
      <li>Any developer with an Apple developer account should be able to
        download the EU versions of browsers globally onto their own iOS devices for the explicit purpose of testing.
        This will allow them to test their software in these browsers, which is critical in allowing Web App/website
        developers to compete. Apple should not be allowed to add undue friction, charge a fee, or restrict these
        browsers in any way that might significantly undermine the extensive manual and automated testing that major
        web
        based products undergo. This will allow the millions of web developers that service the EU to test their
        products.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Apple may point to TestFlight as a possible solution, but this is insufficient. There
      are hard usage caps of 10,000. &nbsp;Given there are 1.1 billion websites worldwide, we would anticipate that
      the
      number of developers that need to test for mobile browsers in the EU would be in the millions and likely
      comparable to the number of developers who download beta versions of Firefox/Chrome/Edge.</p>

    <p>Apple may also point at the xCode simulator as a possible solution, however this is not
      acceptable, as many bugs will only appear on real devices, and development of user interfaces will often require
      the developer to be able to interact with the device to test the responsiveness and feel of the interactions.
      This
      sort of testing is not possible in the simulator.</p>

      4.1.8. Allow Dev/Beta Versions of Browsers on Non-Beta Versions of iOS
    </h3>

    <p>On other operating systems such as macOS, Windows, Linux, and Android, developers can
      download multiple versions of the same browser including Stable, Beta, Dev, and Canary “channels”.
      This allows developers of websites and Web Apps to test their products for compatibility and regressions prior
      to
      new versions of browsers being made available to consumers. This increases the quality and safety of both Web
      Apps
      and browsers.</p>

    <p>Apple’s app store rules contains the following provision:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>2.2 Beta Testing</p>
      <p>Demos, betas, and trial versions of your app don’t belong on the App Store
        – use TestFlight instead. Any app submitted for beta distribution via TestFlight should be intended for
        public distribution and should comply with the App Review Guidelines. Note, however, that apps using
        TestFlight
        cannot be distributed to testers in exchange for compensation of any kind, including as a reward for
        crowd-sourced
        funding. Significant updates to your beta build should be submitted to TestFlight App Review before being
        distributed to your testers. To learn more, visit the TestFlight Beta Testing page.

    <p>Due to this and limits imposed by Apple’s “Test Flight” program it is
      practically ensured that Beta, Dev, and Canary versions of competing browsers are not widely available. The
      number
      of test users required for popular browsers, which are platforms in their own right, is extraordinary among
      apps.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>TestFlight has a 10,000 user limit, which is a tiny fraction of the beta
        population for web browsers with large user bases.The limitation becomes a maintenance burden for browser
        developers: when reaching the limit, old users must be manually removed from the list. The user experience for
        prerelease testers is more complicated than on other platforms: users must download the separate TestFlight
        application, sign up for an access code, wait to receive it, and then paste it into the application.
        Distributing
        with a public link is not feasible because of the user limit restriction.</p>

    <p>Tying of browsers to OSes used to be commonplace, for example with Internet Explorer
      and Microsoft Windows, but in the past 15 years this practice has been abandoned by most browser vendors. Apple
      remains a notable exception, meaning iOS Safari can only be updated when the whole OS updates, and there can
      only
      be a single version of the WebView or Safari at any time. This raises costs on developers who may need to
      procure
      multiple iOS devices to adequately test.</p>

    <p>Given that the purpose of the DMA is to allow rivals to compete to provide better
      functionality, stability, and security, Apple should not be able to restrict browser vendors via app store rules
      from providing Beta, Dev and Canary versions of their products provided they are clearly labeled and marketed as
      such. Specifically, it should amend the rule to make an exemption for browsers.</p>

    <p>Such competition will improve browser testing on iOS and may push Apple to make
      long-needed improvements to provide equivalent functionality for Safari.</p>

    <p>This change will not require any technical changes on Apple’s end nor will it
      require the EU to make any extra-territorial requests. This simply requires Apple to update its contracts and
      app
      store rules to allow this critical use case.</p>

      4.1.9. Browser Choice Screen on iOS
    </h3>

    <p>In order to comply with both the letter and intent of the Digital Markets Acts Article
      6(3) and to make that compliance effective we believe that Apple should make the following changes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Allow browsers to show a single line of text explaining why
        users should pick their browser on the choice screen directly. This line should be allowed to be at least up
        to
        150 characters long.</li>
      <li>The browser choice screen should not be locked to or entrench Apple
        app store. Both the browsers available and the calculation of the top 12 should include browsers downloaded
        either directly or from other app stores. Browser vendors should be able to opt to provide their browsers
        directly to users.</li>
      <li>Once the user has chosen their browser, the selection flow should
        continue to the home screen and download the chosen browser in the background, allowing the user to continue
        their task. Making the user wait with a prominent cancel button undermines the autonomy of users.
      </li>
      <li>Apple should share aggregate statistics with browsers vendors about
        the performance of their browser on the choice screen. This should be daily and automatic. Importantly this
        needs to include enough detail to allow browser vendors to calculate the percentage of the times it is chosen,
        per country, per day. Browser vendors should be free to publicly publish this data if they so choose.
      </li>
      <li>Being set as the default browser should grant the chosen browser the
        <em>hotseat</em>. Under no circumstances should the choice screen show if
        Safari is not already the default browser. Apple should re-show the choice screen to all users that
        currently
        have Safari as their default, and that the choice screen was inappropriately shown too, if they do not have
        this
        data it should be reshown to all users with Safari as the default.
      </li>
      <li>The choice screen should be shown whenever users encounter a new
        reinstallation event, such as purchasing a new phone,
        restoring from an old phone or a factory reset</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This stance is in clear contravention of Article 5(7), 6(7) and 13(4). </p>

    <p>It also undermines the Act’s core purpose in prohibiting imposing browser engines outlined
      in Recital 43, which is to prevent gatekeepers from blocking third-party
      browsers for implementing features for
      <strong>“web software applications”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Browser vendors require the ability to install, manage, and control Web Apps using
      their own engines. This is the only way that browser vendors can compete in the provision of functionality,
      stability, security and privacy for Web Apps.</p>

    <p>As such, Apple must build, update, or provide access to all relevant APIs to install
      Web Apps to browser vendors with the browser engine entitlement. OWA believes the Commission, and competitors,
      are
      owed a full and timely explanation of the implementation plan for these features.</p>

      4.2.2. SFSafariViewController Must Respect Browser Choice
    </h3>

    <p>SFSafariViewController, Apple’s Remote-Tab In-App Browser (IAB) system continues
      to self-preference Safari, denying users access to their default browsers when web pages are loaded within
      third-party apps.</p>

    <p>In order to respect the users choice of default browser as mandated in Article 6(3),
      and to conform with Article 5(7) which prohibits the imposition of a browser engine on end users and business,
      Apple must extend SFSafariViewController and provide an operating system API which other browsers can register
      and
      interoperate with it to be invoked when users click on links in non-browser apps. This can work in a manner
      similar to how Android Custom Tabs works. Apple must provide an implementation plan to the Commission and should
      share its documentation and timeline prior to release, as soon as practicable. OWA suggests this should take
      less
      than 6 months, even with Tranche 1 interventions underway as the engineering work is not large.</p>

    <p>Apple may claim that the fact they allow Native Apps to implement their own in-app
      browser means they are not imposing their browser engine on business users, however, this is an extremely high
      friction barrier: In order not to use Safari's browser engine and instead use the default browser, these
      businesses must invest to build their own WebView browser as opposed to simply calling the appropriate OS
      API.</p>

    <p>Further this also undermines the users choice of default browser by making all native apps that
      call the system default remote tab browser use Safari instead of the users default browser. This, in turn, will
      cause friction as Safari will not share user preferences and history with the user’s default browser,
      resulting in an experience that is dubbed

      4.2.3. Allow Third-Party Browsers to Ship their Own Extensions
    </h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Browser extensions are a key part of the web ecosystem and most popular
        browsers support them. Browser extensions allow developers to add functionality to the browser providing
        increased
        utility, usability, and interoperability with applications installed
        on the system.</p>

      <p>
        For distribution, popular browsers have established extension catalogs that are
        available on the open web and curated by the browser vendors. Because extensions have elevated privileges,
        developers submit them to be approved to ensure safety and compatibility. Browser vendors make their own
        decisions
        about the APIs available to extensions. Extensions for each browser are installed and managed within the
        browser
        resulting in a common user experience across platforms.</p>
      <p>Safari supports extensions distributed on the iOS App Store. However, third-party
        browsers are prevented from offering their own established extension functionality because it would violate
        section 2.5.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines. To allow third-party browsers to offer the same
        functionality
        and be competitive with respect to browser extensibility, the App Store software requirements should be
        relaxed to
        permit third-party browsers to use their own extension catalogs. Third-party browsers could then use the
        existing
        web-based distribution model (where users can browse and install extensions directly from the browser)
        allowing
        for browser extensions to be used on iOS, similarly to other mobile
        and desktop platforms.</p>

    <p>Currently Apple does not allow, and has no plans to allow, third-party browsers to ship
      their own extensions. Currently this functionality is exclusive to browsers that rely on the WKWebView and rely
      on
      extensions shipped via Apple's app store.</p>

    <p>In order to compete fairly, browsers will need the ability to distribute extensions
      directly. This is explicitly prohibited by Apple's current app store rules.</p>

    <p>Apple will need to update their browser entitlement contract and app store rules to
      allow browser vendors to compete in the provision of such functionality. </p>

    <p>Under 5(7), browsers must be allowed to port their extension architecture.</p>

    <p>Apple introduces this friction in five ways:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Third-party browsers cannot prompt users to change the
        default
        via a one-click system prompt.</li>
      <li>Third-party browsers cannot detect whether they are the
        default.</li>
      <li>Safari's settings are prominently positioned on the iOS
        settings page compared to third-party browsers.</li>
      <li>Searching for "default" or "default
        browser" in settings yields no results.</li>
      <li>There is no centralized location for changing default
        apps
        (including browsers) on iOS.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Combined, these factors significantly restrict users' free choice
      in
      selecting and switching between their choice of browser.</p>
    <p>In order to be compliant with this specific aspect of the DMA, we
      believe
      Apple should make the following changes:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Move the option to change default browser out of
        the
        browser settings and into a centralized location.</li>
      <li>Have this option visible, even if Safari is the
        only
        currently installed browser.</li>
      <li>Have this option show up in search if the user
        searches for "default", "browser" or
        "default browser".</li>
      <li>Allow browsers to know if they are the current
        default
        browser.</li>
      <li>Provide a system prompt to browsers (with an
        option to
        never ask again, as is usual for all permission prompts) that allows browsers to prompt the user to
        one-click
        set it as the new default browser. This is standard on most operating systems.</li>

    <p>Currently iOS Safari payments are locked to Apple Pay. As Safari is a core platform
      service it is not allowed to impose a payment service on either end users or business users under Article 5(7).
      Therefore, Safari must be upgraded to support third-party payment services including allowing them to reach
      feature parity with Apple Pay.</p>

    <p>This upgrade must also extend to all WKWebView-based browsers on iOS.</p>

    <p>Given that third-party browsers using their own engine already need to comply with
      extensive security rules in order to be allowed access to the relevant APIs, there is no security justification
      for any additional scare screens or warnings.</p>

    <p>Currently, only a few browser vendors offer their browser through the macOS app store.
      It seems plausible that browsers will want to abandon the iOS app store at some point in the future to avoid
      having to deal with any unreasonable app store guidelines that Apple might impose.</p>

    <p>A key idea in the DMA is that gatekeeper services, such as the Apple’s app store, offered on
      top of operating system core platform services such as iOS are optional, both for users and businesses.
      Businesses
      should be free to distribute directly and users should be free to get software directly from third-party
      developers. If Apple wishes to retain users and business on their app store they must compete to make it more
      attractive. As mentioned before, the only leeway they are given by the act to intervene in these direct
      interactions is via strictly necessary, proportionate and justified security measures to protect the integrity
      of
      the operating system.</p>

    <p>This will be beneficial to competition as it will remove a significant source of power
      Apple has over these browser vendors. However, this future is only possible if the process for installing a
      browser directly is made frictionless and painless.</p>

    <p>We believe that in order to comply with the DMA, Apple should:
    </p><ul>
      <li>Allow browsers to be installed directly from their own
        websites.</li>
      <li>Not place any friction or scare screens in the installation
        process.</li>
      <li>Not place any rules that aim to inhibit or make more expensive
        installations that are not via Apple’s app store.</li>
    </ul>

      4.3.2. Allow Users to Switch the Distribution Method of Native Apps
    </h3>

    <p>The DMA obligates gatekeepers to allow business users to promote and choose the
      distribution channel that they consider most appropriate for the purpose of interacting with any end users;
      those
      business users have already acquired core platform services provided by the gatekeeper.</p>

    <p>This means that business users need to be able to switch the distribution channel of
      individual native apps downloaded by Apple's app store to either direct download or to be managed by another
      app store.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In certain cases, for instance through the imposition of contractual terms and
        conditions, gatekeepers can restrict the ability of business users of their online intermediation services to
        offer products or services to end users under more favourable conditions, including price, through other
        online
        intermediation services or through direct online sales channels. Where such restrictions relate to third-party
        online intermediation services, they limit inter-platform contestability, which in turn limits choice of
        alternative online intermediation services for end users. Where such restrictions relate to direct online
        sales
        channels, they unfairly limit the freedom of business users to use such channels. To ensure that business
        users of
        online intermediation services of gatekeepers can freely choose alternative online intermediation services or
        direct online sales channels and differentiate the conditions under which they offer their products or
        services to
        end users, it should not be accepted that gatekeepers limit business users from choosing to differentiate
        commercial conditions, including price. Such a restriction should apply to any measure with equivalent effect,
        such as increased commission rates or de-listing
        of the offers of business users.</p>

    <p>In this case the core platform service would be the operating system iOS which is
      restricting the ability of users to switch apps between app stores, or being managed directly by the
      developers.</p>

    <p>Switching which store or developer is controlling a particular app should be
      straightforward. To not do so is by design of the operating system and its interfaces undermine effective
      compliance with Recital 39, Recital 40, Article 5(4) and Article 6(6). Apple should build appropriate interfaces
      to facilitate such a switch.</p>

    <p>This also comes with the advantage that should any individual app store become defunct,
      there would now be a mechanism to not orphan apps on that app store. It would also apply great pressure on app
      stores to be reasonable otherwise risk businesses and users switching their existing apps en masse to an
      alternative. Enabling this competitive pressure would benefit both business and consumers.</p>

    <p>Finally, Apple must allow businesses the right to be able to promote this switch, and
      its advantages such as price decreases or extra features, to users which have downloaded the app via Apple's
      app store. There should also be no prohibition via app store rules or contracts on promoting direct download or
      third party app stores in adverts on other third party apps in Apple's app store. This should also include
      the
      case where a business wishes to discontinue offering their app via a particular app store and wishes to promote
      alternative options for users to switch too.</p>

    <p>Apps will need the ability to detect which source is managing their distribution, i.e
      which app store or direct download. An API will need to exist which provides this to the app. This is to allow
      the
      app to appropriately alter its features, interfaces or displayed prices.</p>

    <p>This change will bring significant advantages for consumers and businesses. It will
      allow app stores to be more easily contested by third parties and reduce the entrenchment of the existing body
      of
      installed apps. This will lead to better prices, more competition and greater choice for consumers.</p>

      4.3.3. Direct Install Browsers Should Be Included In Choice Screens
    </h3>

    <p>There is no plausible reason for Apple to exclude browsers from choice screens if they are not
      listed within its app store. Choice screens attempt to remedy the harm from Apple’s historic
      self-preferencing by setting its browser as the default. The article seeks to prevent gatekeepers that might
      "favour its own or third-party services or products on its operating
      system", and so it does not make sense that participation in systems designed to
      redress harms caused by favoring of their own services and products must then rely on forced participation in
      them
      unduly.</p>

    <p>Entrants that choose to entirely avoid Apple's app store should not be penalized
      for this choice. Thus, browsers that are available for direct download should be eligible to appear on the
      choice
      screen.</p>

    <p>It is important that Apple does not entrench an existing core platform service in the
      process of satisfying other obligations of the DMA. In the context of both the intent and letter of the DMA,
      locking all browsers to its app store both mechanically and via its rules does not appear to be
      compliant.Apple must publish the mechanisms for including a “direct install” version of a
      browser on the choice screen. Browser vendors should be allowed to distribute both via the AppStore and
      directly,
      and be able to opt to have the choice screen connected to their direct install version.</p>

    <p>Apple has announced that it intends to notarize apps that are not downloaded by its app

    <blockquote>
      <p>Notarization for iOS apps is a baseline review that applies to all apps,
        regardless of their distribution channel, focused on platform policies for security and privacy and to
        maintain

        apps
        are free of known malware, viruses, or other security threats, function as promised, and don’t expose

    <p>It is our opinion that this policy for third-party browsers which are downloaded
      directly is unproportionate, unnecessary and will in fact worsen security.</p>

    <p>It is important to note that what Apple is proposing is not equivalent to the system
      Apple has for notarization of macOS software which is a fast and automated process.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Notarize your macOS software to give users more confidence that the
        Developer ID-signed software you distribute has been checked by Apple for

        The Apple notary
        service is
        an automated system that scans your software for malicious content, checks for code-signing issues, and
        returns
        the results to you quickly. If there are no issues, the notary service generates a ticket for you to staple to
        your software; the notary service also publishes that ticket online where Gatekeeper can find
        it.

    <p>Were Apple’s proposal simply to apply automatic checks including for code
      signatures that verify the developer is the same developer with the browser entitlement, that would be perfectly
      acceptable.</p>

    <p>Apple’s language however makes it clear that this is “app store
      review” in disguise, although nominally locked to security issues. </p>

    <p>Our concern is that Apple will introduce considerable delay and friction into the
      process of updating browsers. We are also concerned, given Apple’s known abuse of their Apple app store
      review process, that if Apple is in a dispute with a third-party browser, they may attempt to use blocking of
      updates on security ground as a weapon to gain concessions from browser vendors or otherwise wield the fear of
      such a rejection as a tool to limit third-party browsers to compete.</p>

    <p>“Patch gap” is the amount of time between a vulnerability being discovered
      and it being patched on consumers devices. It is a critical aspect of security that this gap is as small as
      possible.</p>

    <p>There is a strong argument that behavior mentioned in the previous two remedies, such as Apple
      preventing an update to Spotify for two weeks, and the pattern of behavior as

    <p>However, this does mean the security measure, in this case the need to notarize the
      third-party browsers, needs to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Be strictly necessary</li>
      <li>Be proportionate</li>
      <li>Be to prevent browsers from endangering the integrity of the
        hardware or operating system provided by the gatekeeper</li>
      <li>Be justified by Apple</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Given there is a strong argument that Apple will in fact worsen security via this
      policy, the onus is on Apple to state a convincing argument on how they intend to improve security with this
      policy, including what additional staffing specifically for third-party browser vendors they are intending on
      hiring to implement it.</p>

    <p>Apple will need to convincingly show why it is strictly necessary and proportionate for
      them to enforce this when all the major browser vendors have their own dedicated security teams.</p>

    <p>They will also need to show why simple rules such as patching at a regular cadence or
      committing to fixing vulnerabilities within a particular time period are not sufficient. For all these rules,
      Safari should be the benchmark; No browser should be penalized for doing a better job at security than
      Safari.</p>

    <p>Apple should guarantee that notarization for third-party browsers, with the browser
      entitlement which are downloaded outside Apple’s app store, is a fast and automatic process. </p>

    <p>Our recommendation is that Apple’s only recourse against third-party browsers
      with serious security issues, which they refuse to fix in a timely manner or that are compromising the operating
      system against the interests of the user, is the option to revoke their browser engine entitlement.</p>

    <p>This needs to be paired with strong financial penalties for Apple, in the event it
      takes such an action without sufficient evidence.</p>

    <p>This setup would remove Apple’s ability to bully browser vendors via threatening
      to delay updates on bogus security grounds, while still granting the ability to outright remove malicious or
      incompetent browsers where strictly necessary, reasonable and justified.</p>

    <p>Apple should be subject to a SLA (Service Level Agreement) in return for the
      ability to impose automated notarization on third parties. It would be our recommendation that the SLA for
      notarization should be less than an average of 15 minutes with a maximum of 1 hour. It is important that Apple
      not
      be left free to abuse the ability to delay app updates. This delay would be solely within Apple’s control
      and no third party software provider would have the ability to improve upon the speed of Apple’s
      notarization.</p>

    <p>A key metric directly downloaded browsers and third party app stores will compete on is
      the ability to provide my timely updates. Allowing Apple the ability to selectively block or make arbitrarily
      slow
      (potentially weeks) particular updates with no explanation significantly undermines competition with Apple's
      app store and grants Apple great power to bully developers who have opted to distribute outside of Apple’s
      app store.</p>

      4.3.5. Apple Should Not Break Updates for EU Residents Traveling Outside The EU
    </h3>

    <p>Apple has stated that it will prevent all updates for apps downloaded from third-party
      app stores that are outside the EU for more than 30 days.</p>

    <p>Apple has not released any explicit statement on what will happen to browsers using their own
      engine downloaded from Apple’s app store if the user (an EU resident) leaves the EU for greater than 30
      days. Given <a href="#testing-for-browser-vendors-and-developers-outside-the-EU">Apple is attempting to block even browser
        vendors from testing on their own test devices outside the EU</a>, it seems likely they
      will attempt to extend a similar policy to third party browsers which use their own engine even if they are
      downloaded from Apple’s app store.</p>

    <p>We would like a statement from Apple clarifying that this does not apply to browsers
      with the browser engine entitlement.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><span>“If you leave the European Union, you can continue to open and use apps that
          you previously installed from alternative app marketplaces. Alternative app marketplaces can continue updating
          those apps for up to 30 days after you leave the European Union, and you can continue using alternative app
          marketplaces to manage previously installed apps. However, you must be in the European Union to install
          alternative app marketplaces and new apps from alternative app marketplaces.”</span></p>

    <p>Importantly:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This has no exemption for EU residents.</li>
      <li>This rule will block security updates.</li>
      <li>Safari is immune to this rule (as it is only available on
        Apple’s app store)</li>
      <li>No other gatekeeper has taken such extreme measures to limit the
        competition the DMA allows to the EU.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Apple has not included any arguments in their statement on why EU residents traveling
      for longer than 30 days cease to be EU residents, nor any discussion on how they will ensure that this policy
      does
      not apply to any EU residents.</p>

    <p>Under

      Schengen countries, and the legal right to stay in each of the 29 countries up to 90 days without the need to
      apply for a travel visa or permit, as there are no borders between these countries. Importantly, among these
      29,
      there are countries like Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, which are not members of the EU. Meaning that, for
      example, a German citizen can legally visit and stay in their summer cottage in Switzerland for up to 90 days.
    </p>

    <p>In the same spirit, the EU and the US have mutual visa-free travel agreements, allowing an EU
      citizen to travel to the US with an
      <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1718648881479291&usg=AOvVaw2EYq-tfnXdiyq-5ZvwDHc4">ESTA
        visa</a> for up to 90 days without losing their status as an EU resident.
    </p>

    <p>Meaning that, a Swedish citizen can legally visit their parents in Norway for up to 90
      days, then fly to Iceland and spend an additional 90 days with their siblings, then fly to the US to visit their
      friends for another 90 days, then spend their summer in Switzerland for up to 90 days, and so can legally stay
      away from the EU for even a year or more if they wish, whilst continuing to be an EU resident throughout.
    </p>

    <p>In addition, according to the
      <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/index_en.htm%23:~:text%3Dyou%2520will%2520usually%2520be%2520considered%2520tax%252Dresident%2520in%2520the%2520country%2520where%2520you%2520spend%2520more%2520than%25206%2520months%2520a%2520year&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1718648881479914&usg=AOvVaw3TK0F7Q_uk3ZOGs-ZvURF7">EU

      Iceland, EU residents are only considered tax residents of another member state after 6 months. A rule which
      is
      more or less globally harmonized to simplify global taxation of individuals. Meaning that the residents of EU
      member states are only legally considered tax-residents of another country after having spent 6 months in the
      destination country.
    </p>

    <p>This means that for a very large number of EU residents traveling outside the EU, or
      working outside the EU, Apple’s arbitrary 30-days rule to prevent app updates actually puts EU
      residents’ cyber-safety and security at great risk. Apps subjected to this policy, in particular browsers,
      will cease to receive security updates.</p>

    <p>This 30-day policy greatly contradicts Apple’s justification claiming that their
      biggest priority is the safety of their users, as they could simply remove the arbitrary 30-day rule, or
      increase
      it to something more reasonable, such as 6 months to a year or more to accommodate and match the legal rights of
      EU residents.</p>

    <p>Even if this policy is scoped by Apple to not apply to browsers shipped on their app
      store, should browsers choose to abandon Apple's app store in the future they will be subject to Apple's
      decision. Allowing browsers the option to ship outside of Apple's app store is an important option to weaken
      Apple's ability to dictate to browsers their form and functionality, will allow browsers to reduce the time
      to
      deploy security patches and will improve their ability to compete fairly and effectively. The right to choose
      how
      to distribute to users is codified in the DMA under Recital 40, Article 5(4) and Article 6(6).</p>

    <p>All businesses serving EU customers should automatically have all of the rights granted

    <p>This is a broad definition that currently covers almost every business supplying an app
      on the iOS app store.</p>

    <p>Apple should not be able to either contract businesses out of their rights under the
      DMA, or attach a price to those rights. </p>

    <p>This is not how any law functions. For example, Apple can not sell iPhones to consumers
      at two different prices, one which abides EU's laws on deceptive advertising, and one that does not; The law
      applies to all of Apple's services and hardware.</p>

    <p>Similarly, Apple should not be able to segment business users into ones for which Apple
      has to abide by the DMA and another for which they do not have to. Rather, Apple should have to automatically
      abide by the DMA for all business users operating within the EU, that is every business that supplies
      applications
      to EU residents.</p>

    <p>Apple should remove its new "alternative contract" and update its existing
      contract such that all business users within the EU are automatically moved onto terms compliant with the DMA.
      All
      of Apple’s pre-existing contracts which apply to the business interactions between end users and business
      users in the EU must be updated to comply with the DMA. Business users should not have the choice of being on
      non-DMA compliant terms. This false choice allows gatekeepers a method of circumventing their responsibilities.

      4.3.7. Core Technology Fee Should Be Removed
    </h3>

    <p>Apple's proposal also includes plans for how they would allow third-party native
      app stores to compete with their own on iOS. This is directly compelled by the act.</p>

    <p>Apple's proposal seems designed to prevent any free app from ever even considering
      moving to a third-party native app store on iOS, or being available for direct download from its own
      website.</p>

    <p>In order to list their app on a third-party app store or on their own website, the app
      developer must sign an alternative contract allowing them the rights granted under the DMA. However, this
      alternative contract comes with significantly different pricing.</p>

    <p>If you choose the second contract, Apple will waive some app store fees but will add a
      new fee called “Core Technology Fee”, summarized as a 50 cent charge per-user per-year, past the
      first
      million downloads.</p>

    <p>Critically, and to OWA’s astonishment,<strong>this also includes
        downloads from the Apple app store</strong>.</p>

    <p>In Apple's own words the fee is: </p>

        technologies, and services that enable them to build and share innovative apps with users around the world.
        Developers can choose to remain on the App Store’s current business terms or adopt the new business

    <p>“Free of charge” being the key and unambiguous phrase.</p>

    <p>For the remaining items, given that it is not possible (or at least very difficult) to
      distribute to iOS without Xcode (by Apple’s design), it is not clear how developers could avoid using
      these
      tools. Many developers would love the ability to be able to develop for iOS without being forced to use Xcode or
      TestFlight, as this would allow developing for iOS without requiring an Apple Mac computer. It seems
      unreasonable
      to charge for usage of software libraries when you have, by contract and technical setup, prevented developers
      from using competing libraries.</p>

    <p>Astonishingly, Apple has added wording that you are <strong>unable to switch back
        to the standard contract</strong> if you are unhappy with the new contract, while still
      granting themselves the right to change either contract at any time.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Developers who adopt the new business terms at any time will not be able to
        switch back to Apple’s existing business terms for their EU apps. Apple will continue to give developers
        advance notice of changes to our terms, so they can make informed choices about their businesses moving
        forward.</p>

    <p>Next, it is worth considering how much it would cost for a browser
      to list on one of these
      third-party app stores. <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.demandsage.com/iphone-user-statistics/">
        iOS has 1.65 billion users</a>. So that is
      16.5 million users for each 1% browser market share. If a
      browser
      vendor dares to list their app on a third-party store, even once, and
      <strong>even if no one
        downloads it</strong> from that third-party store, Apple will bill them <strong>$8.25
        million per year per 1% market share every year with no recourse</strong> to change back to
      the previous contract.
    </p>

    <p>It seems clear this is designed to make it as difficult as possible for free apps to
      list on third-party app stores, depriving alternative app stores of these apps, and preventing their ability to
      succeed.</p>

    <p>Apple should remove the Core Technology Fee entirely, and listing on a third-party app store
      should not be able punitively change additional fees to a business’s
      apps on the Apple app store in
      <strong>retaliation</strong> for listing on other app stores on iOS.
    </p>

    <p>Under pressure Apple has added some exceptions to Core Technology Fee
      including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Nonprofit organizations</li>
      <li>Developers who’s apps collectively have less than 1 million
        users.</li>
      <li>A phase-in period of 3 years for developers that hit $10 million+
        revenue</li>
      <li>Students, hobbyists, and other non-commercial developers with a
        no-revenue business.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The last one is important as it is designed to prevent businesses from listing a free app either
      directly via their website or third party app stores if they have
      <strong>any</strong> apps with
      revenue.
    </p>

    <p>None of these concessions solve the underlying problem. Apple is attempting to charge
      fees on interactions between customers and businesses of which they have no part and provide no service beyond
      that which comes with their operating system by default. These are apps not installed via Apple’s app
      store
      on devices that Apple has already sold at incredibly high margins to consumers. This type of behavior is clearly
      against both the intent and letter of the DMA. </p>

    <p>If Apple wishes to make additional revenue from consumers who purchase their devices in
      the EU, they need to do it by making their app store and their optional services (Safari, iCloud, Apple TV,
      Apple
      Music etc) more attractive. They should not attempt to siphon revenue from consumers and businesses which are
      opting to not use either for particular apps. </p>

    <p>Further they should not apply punitive pricing to these same apps on their own app
      store for daring to list outside of it.</p>

      4.3.7.1. The Fair Price for API Access
    </h4>

    <p>Even though the DMA explicitly sets the cost of access to these APIs at zero, it is
      worthwhile discussing what the “fair” price is.</p>

    <h5 id="value-of-ip-in-apis">
      <a class="header-anchor" href="#value-of-ip-in-apis" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
      4.3.7.1.1. Value of IP in APIs
    </h5>

    <p>Clearly Apple does not believe that they have IP rights over the general category of
      each of these APIs, otherwise with their over billion USD a year legal budget they would have sued other
      operating
      systems for violating their IP (eg Windows, Android, Linux etc).</p>

    <p>So the question arises does the IP in Apple's iOS API's actually provide value
      or is the real value being able to have sufficient access to the operating system hardware and software to
      provide
      needed functionality to consumers. It is important to remember that only Apple has control over what APIs are
      available on iOS and so all of them are by definition made by Apple and likely contain Apple's IP even if
      they
      are stock standard and available on every operating system. In a sense it is like Apple is simply charging for
      the
      ability to have certain functionality on iOS rather than charging for the value of the IP in those APIs.
    </p>

    <p>One thought experiment to illustrate this is, to imagine for a particular API that
      Apple also implemented a replica of Androids equivalent for that API for iOS. &nbsp;Developers are then asked
      whether and how much more they would be willing to pay for Apple's version of the API containing Apple's
      IP instead of using the Android APIs. If the answer is zero or low then we believe that the amount Apple should
      be
      allowed to charge under should be equally low as this would indicate the the value of the IP in this case was
      low
      or zero. </p>

      <a class="header-anchor" href="#comparable-licenses" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
      4.3.7.1.2. Comparable licenses
    </h5>

    <p>Another avenue for deciding reasonable prices is to look at the comparable licenses
      charged to other developers. Other operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS and Android all do
      not charge for access to system APIs. That is the comparable cost of licenses charged to other developers on
      other
      platforms is zero.</p>

    <p>It is worth noting that iOS also does not currently charge for API access. Nowhere in
      <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1718648881492740&usg=AOvVaw2XYSmUlj7BbRVcE5Hg-w73">Apple’s

      4.3.7.1.3. Apple Developer Fee
    </h5>

    <p>Apple also charges all developers $100 USD per a year to be part of the developer
      program. With 34 million registered developers, this is a business worth at least $100m a year to Apple, quite
      plausibly significantly higher than the budget Apple has for API development for iOS. Apple currently plans to
      charge this developer fee even to developers that do not distribute via their app store but rather distribute
      directly or via third party app stores.</p>

    <p>The fact that Apple already derives considerable income directly from developers
      wishing to distribute an app on their operating system is a significant factor.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I get it — saying “Spotify pays Apple nothing’ is a much
        stronger lobbying position than ‘Spotify pays Apple just $99 a year, the same as every other
        developer’. But only if it is, you know, true. And Apple makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year
        from
        charging that fee to developers as standard, which complicates the narrative that the App Store is only funded
        by
        commission on sales.</p>
      <p>I tried asking Apple how they squared this, and a spokesperson repeated the claim
        that Spotify paid $0 to Apple. When I asked if I could explicitly write that
        ‘Apple claimed that Spotify
        is
        not charged the developer fee’, though, the company stopped replying to my emails. Spotify had no such
        bashfulness, and confirmed that they pay the fee like all major developers.</p>

    <p>Apple policy personnel are clearly aware of this and have previously directly lied in

      4.3.7.1.4. Why Apple Should Not be Allowed to Charge for API Access
    </h5>

    <p>We believe that charging for access to APIs is deeply problematic for a number of
    </p>
    <p>reasons, and may end up being used as a tool to significantly hinder competition by
      potentially unscrupulous gatekeepers.</p>

    <p>In mandating that such API access must be free, we believe that the authors of the DMA
      had tremendous foresight into the games that large gatekeepers would play were they granted such a weapon to use
      against those who would contest their hardware and services.</p>

    <p>They should not be able to charge for the following reasons:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Could be a mechanism to hinder competition</li>
      <li>Gatekeepers effectively can’t charge themselves</li>
      <li>Face no competitive pressure to lower prices for API access</li>
      <li>Will lock out smaller players</li>
      <li>Consumers not the gatekeepers own their devices</li>
      <li>Difficult to enforce reasonable pricing</li>
      <li>No benefit to consumers but potential for considerable harm</li>
      <li>Is not and will not be the gatekeepers’ primary business
        model</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Allowing such fees opens the door to Apple and other gatekeepers to charge unreasonable
      prices and lock out competition and is in our view a strictly worse option than mandating free access to these
      APIs.</p>

    <p>Given these APIs have no significant value above what is offered on other operating systems, the
      fact developers are in fact forced to use them via virtue of it being the only choice on iOS, that developers
      are
      already paying Apple $100 USD per year and that allowing Apple to charge for this access will lead to
      considerable
      harm for consumers by suppressing the contestability of third party services, the fair price for these APIs is
      zero.</p>

      phrases such as "Core Technology Fee" or "CTF" do not appear once in the document.</p>

    <p>The lack of detail in Apple's compliance report makes it impossible for

    <p>Without a full and detailed compliance report from Apple, it makes it significantly
      more difficult for us, or any other party, to analyze their compliance.</p>

    <p>The commission should consider requiring Apple to release a more detailed compliance report where
      redactions from their existing confidential submission to the Commission are strictly limited to "business
      secrets and other confidential information". In the event that their confidential submission is lacking
      sufficient detail they should be forced to rectify it or be fined.

      5. Toward A Brighter Future
    </h2>

    <p>OWA believes that the Web’s unmatched track record of safely providing
      frictionless access to information and services has demonstrated that it can enable a more vibrant digital
      ecosystem. The web’s open, interoperable, standards-based nature creates an inclusive environment that
      fosters competition, delivering the benefits of technology to users more effectively and reliably than any
      closed
      ecosystem.</p>

    <p>OWA’s goal is to ensure that browser competition is carried out under fair terms,
      that user choice in browsers matters, and that web applications are provided equal access and rights necessary
      to
      safely contest the market for digital services.</p>

    <p>By standing firm against Apple’s malicious compliance and forcing them to comply with their
      obligations under the act as intended, the Commission can improve interoperability, contestability, and fairness
      leading to lower priced and higher quality apps
      — not only for the EU but for the entire world.</p>

    <p><strong>OWA believes competition, not walled gardens, leads to the brightest future for
        consumers, businesses, and the digital ecosystem.</strong></p>

      7. Open Web Advocacy
    </h2>

    <p>Open Web Advocacy is a not-for-profit organization made up of a loose group of
      software engineers from all over the world, who work for many different companies and have come together
      to fight
      for the future of the open web by providing regulators, legislators and policy makers the intricate
      technical
      details that they need to understand the major anti-competitive issues in our industry and potential ways
      to solve
      them.</p>
    <p><span>It should be noted that all the authors and reviewers of this document are software
        engineers and not economists, lawyers or regulatory experts. The aim is to explain the current situation,
        outline
        the specific problems, how this affects consumers and suggest potential regulatory remedies. </span></p>
    <p><span>This is a grassroots effort by software engineers as individuals and not on behalf of
        their employers or any of the browser vendors. We are available to regulators, legislators and policy
        makers for presentations/Q&amp;A and we can provide expert technical analysis on topics in this area. </span></p>
    <p><span>For those who would like to help or join us in fighting for a free and open future for
        the web, please contact us at:</span></p>
