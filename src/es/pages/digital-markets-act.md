The Digital Markets Act is a landmark piece of regulation from the European Union.  

The Act aims to ensure that major tech platforms behave in a fair way online, and specifically to the interest of Open Web Advocacy, it ensures that players like Apple, Google and others must make access to the Open Web fairer by allowing a diverse range of browsers to compete. 

You can find out more about the DMA on the [EU's own website](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en), along with our own posts discussing how the DMA is affecting browser competition [on our blog](https://open-web-advocacy.org/tag/eu/).
