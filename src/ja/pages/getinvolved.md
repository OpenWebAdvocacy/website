Join us in advocating for the open web. There are many ways you can help, from contacting legislators and regulators to helping collect and document evidence of anti-competitive behavior.

Unlike groups who operate on behalf of major organizations, we are unbacked, unfunded and rely on individuals to contribute their time and expertise. If you believe in the future of the web, you can help make that future a reality.

Specifically, we are looking for people with any of the following:

1. A strong passion for an open web
2. Experience working with web technologies
3. Experience with internet or technology policy
4. Experience with advocacy or grassroots campaigning efforts

If you are excited about the work we do and want to learn more, you can do so by contacting us via <a href="https://discord.gg/x53hkqrRKx">Discord</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenWebAdvocacy">Twitter</a>, <a href='https://mastodon.social/@owa' rel='me'>Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/open-web-advocacy.org">Bluesky</a> or send us an <a href="mailto:contactus@open-web-advocacy.org">email</a>.
