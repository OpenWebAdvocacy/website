[Bruce](https://brucelawson.co.uk) published an [article](https://brucelawson.co.uk/2023/the-ntia-report-on-mobile-app-ecosystems/) where he gives us a summary of the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration) report on Mobile App Competition.

> The question now is whether Apple will do the right thing, or seek to hurl lawyers with procedural arguments at it instead, as they're doing in the UK now.

> But for every month they delay, they earn a fortune; it's estimated that Google pays Apple $20 Billion to be the default search engine in Safari, and the App Store earned Apple $72.3 Billion in 2020.

Apple's App Store revenue is ~ $72.3 billion, of which they tax app developers between 15% and (likely more often) 30%. If we assume Apple always takes the full 30%, they would receive just shy of $21.7 billion. Apple would still need some of that money to pay for the operating costs of the App Store.

The $20 billion from Google is likely almost all profit.

That's 11% of Apple's yearly profit for doing nothing except banning their competitors from iOS 🤯

**Browser ban = higher market share for safari = Google search engine revenue**
