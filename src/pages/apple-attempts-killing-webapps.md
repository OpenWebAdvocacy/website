**Apple has officially announced that they attempting to kill web apps in the EU, which will have ramifications worldwide.**

## ACT NOW

**We need immediate support from web developers and businesses that operate online in the EU**.  The European Commission needs to hear from YOU to understand the devastating impact Apple’s new ban will have on your livelihoods, businesses and customers.

To facilitate this, [please sign our open letter](https://letter.open-web-advocacy.org/) so that we can understand the scale of the impact and provide it to the European Commission in a single large submission.

**If you completed this form before Feburary 21st, please complete it again - we've got new information we're trying to gather!**

If you are not in the EU, or you’ve already sent us your information, please share this message far and wide. We need information immediately to have an effect on this outlandish change from Apple, designed to crush the web entirely.

<p><strong>Are you established in the EU and have an Apple Developer Account?</strong></p>
<p>If you are, we encourage you to write directly to Apple to request preservation of the existing functionality that allows Safari and other iOS browsers to add Web Apps to the home screen, allows them to run in top-level activities (not in tabs), integrates with iOS settings and permissions, enables Push Notifications and homescreen icon badging, allows persistent storage, and to run fullscreen. </p>

## What’s happening?

Apple have announced a series of changes designed to comply with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act.

Throughout this process, they’ve chosen to maliciously comply as much as possible, resulting in a series of decisions meant to cripple the ability for anyone to compete on their platform outside of their App Store.

You can read more about the changes they’ve made in these two blog posts:
