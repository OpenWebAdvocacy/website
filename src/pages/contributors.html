<p>Open Web Advocacy is a not-for-profit organization made up of a loose group of software engineers from all over the world,
  who work for many different companies who have come together to fight for the future of the open web by providing regulators,
  legislators and policy makers the intricate technical details that they need to understand the major anti-competitive issues
  in our industry and potential ways to solve them.</p>
<p>Open Web Advocacy was started in March 2021 by brothers Alex and James Moore.
  Early contributors include Stuart Langridge and Bruce Lawson were interviewed for a piece in The Register &ndash;
