## What do we do?

Open Web Advocacy is a not-for-profit whose mission is to educate regulators, policymakers, businesses and the public about the intricate technical details that they need to understand both the major anti-competitive issues related to browsers and web apps, and the promise of a more open and competitive future offered by capable web apps. 

We aim to allow both browsers and web apps to compete fairly on all operating systems. At the heart of this is ending [Apple’s longstanding ban on third-party browser engines on iOS](/blog/apples-browser-engine-ban-persists-even-under-the-dma/).

We do this by talking to regulators all over the world including in the EU, the UK, Japan and Australia. We also produce educational content and talks with the aim of explaining key issues that are holding back the mobile web and how to fix them.

We believe that as a direct result of our work the following achievements have been made:

* [Apple reversed its decision to remove key web app functionality in the EU](https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/apple-backs-off-killing-web-apps/)  
* [Apple has been prohibited from banning browser engines in the EU](https://open-web-advocacy.org/apple-dma-review/)  
* [Apple has been prohibited from banning browser engines in Japan](https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/japan-apple-must-lift-engine-ban-by-december/)  
* [Apple now allows browser vendors to test their own browsers outside the EU](https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/owa-2024-review/#got-apple-to-let-browser-vendors-test-their-own-browsers)  
* [Apple no longer hides the option to change default browser if Safari is the default](https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/owa-2024-review/#made-apple-fix-their-trick-of-hiding-the-default-browser-option-if-safari-was-the-default)  
* [Apple has implemented push notifications for iOS Safari](https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/uk-regulators-final-verdict--apples-browser-engine-ban-harms-competition/#:~:text=Two%20weeks%20later%20\(and%20after%20more%20than%20a%20decade%20of%20refusing%20to%20do%20so\)%2C%20Apple%20quietly%20began%20work%20on%20push%20notifications%20for%20iOS%20Safari.)  
* [Apple has implemented a global defaults page on iOS](https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/apple-adopts-6-owa-choice-architecture-recommendations/#:~:text=The%20option%20to%20change%20default%20browser%20should%20be%20moved%20out%20of%20the%20browser%20settings%20and%20into%20a%20centralised%20location.)  
* [Apple grants the hotseat to the selected browser in the EU browser choice screen](https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/owa-2024-review/#secured-hotseat-placement-on-the-eu-choice-screen)

The Web could be an outstanding mobile application platform. It already dominates on desktop, where more than 70 percent of user time is powered by web technologies. It offers so many innate advantages: build once with a single code base, run smoothly on every operating system, enjoy strong security, high performance, broad interoperability, and freedom from gatekeepers. No fees. No app store rules. No app review. Consumers win through higher quality, more secure, more private and cheaper software. Developers win by having a direct relationship with their customers free from gatekeeper fees, censorship and control.

Yet this future is being prevented by anti-competitive practices. If we work together, we can change that and create a world where the Web can finally compete on equal terms across all platforms.

**The Web is the world's only truly interoperable check against operating system platform monopolies. It <span style="color: var(--main-color);">must</span> be allowed to compete fairly.**
