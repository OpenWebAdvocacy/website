<p class="home-intro">
  We are a group of software engineers from all over the world who have come together to advocate for the
  <strong>future of the open web</strong> by providing regulators, legislators and policy makers the intricate technical details that they need to understand the major anti-competitive issues in our industry and how to solve them.

<div class="highlight">
  <h2>What is at stake?</h2>

  <div class="group">
    <p>The entire future of Application Development is at stake. Without regulatory or
      legislative change, we risk losing a universal, free and open, write once, deploy anywhere,
      application distribution and deployment system which will dramatically lower costs
      for businesses and consumers.</p>
    <p>Without these changes, funding will shift to proprietary ecosystems and gatekeepers
      can extract heavy taxes. It will lock in their control and reduce innovation for
      mobile apps for many years to come.</p>

    <h2>Where do we start?</h2>
    <p>As an ad hoc group of web developers, we became convinced that the
      <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AppleBrowserBan&amp;f=live">#AppleBrowserBan</a>
      represents a major threat to the future of the open web. When the UK monopoly regulator,
      Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched its
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-ecosystems-market-study">market study into mobile
      ecosystems</a>, some of our UK &ldquo;members&rdquo; were invited to brief the CMA.</p>

    <p>We wrote our Regulatory Submission, <em>&ldquo;<a href="/walled-gardens-report/">Bringing Competition
      to Walled Gardens</a>&rdquo;</em> as part of this investigation.</p>

      <dd><strong>Apple's ban of third party browsers</strong> on iOS is deeply anti-competitive,
        starves the Safari/WebKit team of funding and has stalled innovation for the past 10 years
        and prevented Web Apps from taking off on mobile.</dd>

      <dt>Deep System Integration</dt>
      <dd><strong> Apps need to become just Apps.</strong> Apps built with the free and open web
        need equal treatment and integration. Closed and heavily taxed proprietary ecosystems
        should not receive any preference.</dd>

      <dt>Web App Equality</dt>
      <dd><strong>All artifical barriers placed by gatekeepers must be removed.</strong> Web
        Apps if allowed can offer equivalent functionality with greater privacy and security
        for demanding use-cases.</dd>

    <h2>Are you working on behalf of a major company?</h2>

    <p><em>(Update 1 March 22)</em> We didn't initially sign this document for two reasons:
      firstly, we want discussion to be about the <strong>facts</strong>, not
      personalities. Secondly, some of our livelihoods depend on Apple allowing our products
      in the App Store. Here are some of our members who are comfortable being named,
      to show we are &ldquo;real people&rdquo; and not Google/ Mozilla/ Microsoft PR.

    <p>None of the big companies were advocating for the open web and web apps, that's
    why we rely on unpaid, volunteer time from software engineers. We have not received
    any funding, and are not working on behalf of any major company.</p>
