  "Australia - New Laws for Digital Platforms. In-principle agreement reached. The code of conduct for mobile OS services could require Designated Digital Platforms to allow third-party browser engines to be used on their mobile OS. This could allow third-party providers of browsers and web apps to compete on their merits. We also consider that the additional competition measures should include the ability to provide third-party providers of apps and services with reasonable and equivalent access to hardware, software and functionality through their mobile OS. ACCC - Digital Platform Services Inquiry #5",

The Australian government has agreed to [new competition laws for digital platforms](https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/consumers-and-small-businesses-to-benefit-from-proposed-new-regulation-of-digital-platforms)!

This is excellent news and will pave the way for fair and effective browser competition on all operating systems & allow Web Apps to compete on an equal footing with Native Apps.

The new laws will be based on the ACCC's recommendations in their [Digital platform services inquiry - Interim report No. 5](https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%20platform%20services%20inquiry%20-%20September%202022%20interim%20report.pdf) which includes:

> The code of conduct for mobile OS services could require Designated Digital Platforms to allow third-party browser engines to be used on their mobile OS. This could allow third-party providers of browsers and web apps to compete on their merits.

> We also consider that the additional competition measures should include the ability to provide third-party providers of apps and services with reasonable and equivalent access to hardware, software and functionality through their mobile OS.

This is important as, Apple has effectively banned third party browsers via [their 2.5.6 rule](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#:~:text=2.5.6%20Apps%20that%20browse%20the%20web%20must%20use%20the%20appropriate%20WebKit%20framework%20and%20WebKit%20Javascript.):
> 2.5.6 Apps that browse the web must use the appropriate WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript.

We believe that browsers should compete on merit and user choice, not via control of operating systems or other underhanded behaviour. Browser competition is important as it is this competition that pushes browser vendors to secure their products, fix bugs and add new features.

Stay tuned as we will be posting about its progress as more information becomes available.
