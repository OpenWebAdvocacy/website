Last week, OWA submitted an intervention document to the European Commision (EC) to provide our perspective on Google Android’s “WebAPK” system, and how it unfairly advantages Chrome on Android devices, over other browsers. 

In summary, our submission covers:

* Other browsers are at a disadvantage for offering PWA installation because Google’s system is the only plausible way to offer high-quality web apps to Android users across the fragmented Android ecosystem
  * Other browsers have been forced to use the “shortcut” API that Chrome launched with in 2015, but which fails to install correctly on more than half of all Android devices.
  * Since 2017, Google’s better system (“WebAPKs”) has allowed Chrome to offer PWAs that integrate better with the OS, such as allowing PWAs to show up in the “all apps” drawer, as well as making them simpler to uninstall.
* OWA requests that the EC compel Google to give competing browsers the same access to infrastructure.
  * There are other possible ways this could be implemented, but because of Android fragmentation, access to the WebAPK service that Google runs is the only credible answer.
* OWA also requests the EC compel Google to implement backup and restore functionality for WebAPKs.
  * Today, web apps are not restored when uses switch phones and Chrome, the only browser that has had access to the ability to do high-quality restore without system support since 2017, has failed to provide a functioning PWA restore feature.
  * This limits the effectiveness of PWAs for users and for businesses.
* OWA believes that Google needs to implement system-level backup and restore for WebAPKs, for both Chrome and for competing browsers.
